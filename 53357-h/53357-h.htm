<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>AN
ENCHANTED PLACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> elder brothers insisted on
their rights with undue harshness, or when the grown-up people
descended from Olympus with a tiresome tale of broken furniture
and torn clothes, the groundlings of the schoolroom went into
retreat.&nbsp; In summer-time this was an easy matter; once
fairly escaped into the garden, any climbable tree or shady shrub
provided us with a hermitage.&nbsp; There was a hollow tree-stump
full of exciting insects and pleasant earthy smells that never
failed us, or, for wet days, the tool-shed, with its armoury of
weapons with which, in imagination, we would repel the attacks of
hostile forces.&nbsp; But in the game that was our childhood, the
garden was out of bounds in winter-time, and we had to seek other
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>lairs.&nbsp;
Behind the schoolroom piano there was a three-cornered refuge
that served very well for momentary sulks or sudden alarms.&nbsp;
It was possible to lie in ambush there, at peace with our
grievances, until life took a turn for the better and tempted us
forth again into the active world.</p>
<p>But when the hour was tragic and we felt the need for a
hiding-place more remote, we took our troubles, not without a
recurring thrill, to that enchanted place which our elders
contemptuously called the &ldquo;mouse-cupboard.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was a low cupboard that ran the whole length of the big
attic under the slope of the roof, and here the aggrieved spirit
of childhood could find solitude and darkness in which to scheme
deeds of revenge and actions of a wonderful magnanimity turn by
turn.&nbsp; Luckily our shelter did not appeal to the utilitarian
minds of the grown-up folk or to those members of the younger
generation who were beginning to trouble about their
clothes.&nbsp; You had to enter it on your hands and knees; it
was dusty, and the mice obstinately disputed our
possession.&nbsp; On the inner walls the plaster <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>seemed to be
oozing between the rough laths, and through little chinks and
crannies in the tiles overhead our eyes could see the sky.&nbsp;
But our imaginations soon altered these trivial blemishes.&nbsp;
As a cave the mouse-cupboard had a very interesting
history.&nbsp; As soon as the smugglers had left it, it passed
successively through the hands of Aladdin, Robinson Crusoe, Ben
Gunn, and Tom Sawyer, and gave satisfaction to them all, and it
would no doubt have had many other tenants if some one had not
discovered that it was like the cabin of a ship.&nbsp; From that
hour its position in our world was assured.</p>
<p>For sooner or later our dreams always returned to the
sea&mdash;not, be it said, to the polite and civilised sea of the
summer holidays, but to that sea on whose foam there open magic
casements, and by whose crimson tide the ships of Captain Avery
and Captain Bartholomew Roberts keep faithful tryst with the
<i>Flying Dutchman</i>.&nbsp; It needed no very solid vessel to
carry our hearts to those enchanted waters&mdash;a paper boat
floating in a saucer served well enough <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>if the wind was propitious&mdash;so
the fact that our cabin lacked portholes and was of an unusual
shape did not trouble us.&nbsp; We could hear the water bubbling
against the ship&rsquo;s side in a neighbouring cistern, and
often enough the wind moaned and whistled overhead.&nbsp; We had
our lockers, our sleeping-berths, and our cabin-table, and at one
end of the cabin was hung a rusty old cutlass full of notches; we
would have hated any one who had sought to disturb our illusion
that these notches had been made in battle.&nbsp; When we were
stowaways even the mice were of service to us, for we gave them a
full roving commission as savage rats, and trembled when we heard
them scampering among the cargo.</p>
<p>But though we cut the figure of an old admiral out of a
Christmas number, and chased slavers with Kingston very happily
for a while, the vessel did not really come into her own until we
turned pirates and hoisted the &ldquo;Jolly Roger&rdquo; off the
coast of Malabar.&nbsp; Then, by the light of guttering candles,
the mice witnessed some strange sights.&nbsp; If any of us had
any money we <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>would carouse terribly, drinking ginger-beer like water,
and afterwards water out of the ginger-beer bottles, which still
retained a faint magic.&nbsp; Jam has been eaten without bread on
board the <i>Black Margaret</i>, and when we fell across a
merchantman laden with a valuable consignment of dried
apple-rings&mdash;tough fare but interesting&mdash;and the
savoury sugar out of candied peel, there were boisterous times in
her dim cabin.&nbsp; We would sing what we imagined to be sea
chanties in a doleful voice, and prepare our boarding-pikes for
the next adventure, though we had no clear idea what they really
were.</p>
<p>And when we grew weary of draining rum-kegs and counting the
pieces of eight, our life at sea knew quieter though no less
enjoyable hours.&nbsp; It was pleasant to lie still after the
fever of battle and watch the flickering candles with drowsy
eyes.&nbsp; Surely the last word has not been said on the charm
of candle-light; we liked little candles&mdash;dumpy sixteens
they were perhaps&mdash;and as we lay they would spread among us
their attendant shadows.&nbsp; Beneath us the water chuckled <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>restlessly, and
sometimes we heard the feet of the watch on deck overhead, and
now and again the clanging of the great bell.&nbsp; In such an
hour it was not difficult to picture the luminous tropic seas
through which the <i>Black Margaret</i> was making her way.&nbsp;
The skies of irradiant stars, the desert islands like baskets of
glowing flowers, and the thousand marvels of the enchanted
ocean&mdash;we saw them one and all.</p>
<p>It was strange to leave this place of shadows and silences and
hour-long dreams to play a humble part in a noisy, gas-lit world
that had not known these wonders; but there were
consolations.&nbsp; Elder brothers might prevail in argument by
methods that seemed unfair, but, beneath a baffled exterior, we
could conceal a sublime pity for their unadventurous lives.&nbsp;
Governesses might criticise our dusty clothes with wearisome
eloquence, but the recollection that women were not allowed on
board the <i>Black Margaret</i> helped us to remain
conventionally polite.&nbsp; Like the gentleman in Mr.
Wells&rsquo;s story, we knew that there were better dreams, and
the knowledge raised us for a while <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>above the trivial passions of our
environment.</p>
<p>We were not the only children who had found the mouse-cupboard
a place of enchantment, for when we explored it first we
discovered a handful of wooden beads carefully hidden in a cranny
in the wall.&nbsp; These breathed of the nursery rather than of
the schoolroom, and yet, perhaps, those forgotten children had
known what we knew, and our songs of the sea stirred only
familiar echoes.&nbsp; It is likely enough that to-day other
children have inherited our dreams, and that other hands steer
the <i>Black Margaret</i> under approving stars.&nbsp; If this
indeed be so, they are in our debt, for in one of our
hiding-places we left the &ldquo;Count of Monte Cristo&rdquo; in
English, rare treasure-trove for any proper boy.&nbsp; If this
should ever meet his eyes he will understand.</p>
<h2><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>A
RAILWAY JOURNEY</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">suppose</span> that when little boys
made their journeys by coach with David Copperfield or Tom Brown
and his pea-shooting comrades they did in truth find adventure
easier to achieve than we who were born in an age of
railways.&nbsp; But though the rarer joys of far travel by road
were denied us, it did not need Mr. Rudyard Kipling in a didactic
mood to convince us that there was plenty of romance in railway
journeys if you approached them in the right spirit.&nbsp; We
were as fond of playing at trains as most small boys, and a
stationary engine with the light of the furnace glowing on the
grim face of the driver was a disquieting feature of all my
nightmares.&nbsp; So when the grown-up people announced that one
of us was to make a long journey young Ulysses became for the
moment an envied and enchanted <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>figure.&nbsp; Our periodical
excursions to London were well enough in their way; noisy, jolly
parties in reserved carriages to pantomimes and the Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s Show, or matter-of-fact visits to the dentist or
the shops.&nbsp; But we all knew the features of the landscape on
the way to London by heart, and it was the thought of voyaging
through the unknown that fired our lively blood, our hazy sense
of geography enabling us to believe that all manner of marvels
were to be seen by young eyes from English
railway-carriages.&nbsp; Also we did not feel that we were real
travellers until we had left all our own grown-ups behind, though
in such circumstances we had to put up with the indignity of
being confided to the care of the guard.&nbsp; Until children
have votes they will continue to suffer from such slights as
this!</p>
<p>One morning in early spring I left London for the north.&nbsp;
The adult who saw me off performed his task on the whole very
well.&nbsp; True, he introduced me to the guard, a bearded and
sinister man; but, on the other hand, he realised the importance
of my having a corner seat, and only once or twice <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>committed the
error of treating me as if I were a parcel.&nbsp; For my part, I
was at pains to conceal my excitement beneath the mannerisms of
an experienced traveller.&nbsp; I put the window up and down
several times and read aloud all the notices concerning
luncheon-baskets and danger-signals.&nbsp; Then my companion
shook hands with me in a sensible, manly fashion, and the train
started.&nbsp; I sat back and examined my fellow-travellers, and
found them rather disappointing.&nbsp; There were three ladies,
manifestly of the aunt kind, and a stiff, well-behaved little
girl who might have stepped out of one of my sister&rsquo;s
story-books.&nbsp; She was reading a book without pictures, and
when I turned over the pages of my magazines she displayed no
interest in them whatever.&nbsp; I could never read in the train,
so, with a tentative effort at good manners, I pushed them
towards her, but she shook her head; to show her that I did not
think this was a snub I pulled out my packet of sandwiches and
had my lunch.&nbsp; After that I played with the blind, which
worked with a spring, until one of the aunts told me not to
fidget, although she was no <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>aunt of mine.&nbsp; Then I looked out
of the window, a prey to voiceless wrath.</p>
<p>By now we had left London far behind, and when I had finished
composing imaginary retorts to the unscrupulous aunt I was quite
content to see the wonders of the world flit by.&nbsp; There were
hills and valleys decked with romantic woods and set with
fascinating and secretive ponds.&nbsp; To my eyes the hills were
mountains and the valleys perilous hollows, the accustomed lairs
of tremendous dragons.&nbsp; I saw little thatched houses wherein
swart witches awaited the coming of Hansel and Gretel, and fairy
children waved to me from cottage gardens and the gates of
level-crossings, greetings which I dutifully returned until the
aunt made me pull up the window.&nbsp; After a while a change
came over the scenery.&nbsp; The placid greens and browns of the
countryside blossomed to gold and purple and crimson.&nbsp; I saw
a roc float across the arching sky on sluggish wings, and my eyes
were delighted with visions of deserts and mosques and
palm-trees.&nbsp; That my fellow-passengers would not raise their
heads to behold <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>these marvels did not trouble me; I beat on the window
with delight, until, like little Billee in Thackeray&rsquo;s
ballad, I saw Jerusalem and Madagascar and North and South
Amerikee.</p>
<p>Then something surprising happened.&nbsp; I saw the earth leap
up and invade the sky and the sky drop down and blot out the
earth, and I felt as though my wings were broken.&nbsp; Then the
sides of the carriage closed in and squeezed out the door like a
pip out of an orange, until there was only a three-cornered gap
left.&nbsp; The air was full of dust, and I sneezed again and
again, but could not find my pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; Presently
a young man came and lifted me out through the hole, and seemed
very surprised that I was not hurt.&nbsp; I realised that there
had been an accident, for the train was broken into pieces and
the permanent way was very untidy.&nbsp; Close at hand I saw the
little girl sitting on a bank, and a man kneeling at her feet
taking her boots off.&nbsp; I would have liked to speak to her,
but I remembered how she had refused the offer of my magazines,
and was afraid she would <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>snub me again.&nbsp; The place was
very noisy, for people were calling out, and there was a great
sound of steam.&nbsp; I noticed that everybody&rsquo;s face was
very white, especially the guard&rsquo;s, which made his beard
seem as black as soot.&nbsp; The young man took me by the hand
and led me along the uneven ground, and there was so much to see
that my feet kept stumbling over things, and he had to hold me
up.&nbsp; On the way we passed the body of a man lying with a rug
over his head.&nbsp; I knew that he was dead; but I had seen
drunken men in the streets lie like that, and I could not help
looking about for the policeman.&nbsp; Soon we came to a little
station, and the platform was crowded with people who would not
stand still, but walked round and round making noises.&nbsp; When
I climbed up on the platform a woman caught hold of me and cried
over me.&nbsp; One of her tears fell on my ear and tickled me;
but she held me so tightly that I could not put up my hand to rub
it.&nbsp; Her breath was hot on my head.</p>
<p>Then I heard a detested voice say, &ldquo;Poor little boy, so
tired!&rdquo; and I shuddered back <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>into consciousness of the world that
was least interesting of all the worlds I knew.&nbsp; I need not
have opened my eyes to be sure that the aunts were at their fell
work again, and that the little girl&rsquo;s snub nose was tilted
to a patronising angle.&nbsp; Had I awakened a minute later she,
too, would have joined in the auntish chorus of compassion for my
weakness.&nbsp; As it was, I looked at her with drowsy pity,
finding that she was one of those luckless infants who might as
well stay at home for all the fun they get out of
travelling.&nbsp; She knew no better than to scream when the
train ran into a tunnel; what would she have done if she had seen
my roc?</p>
<p>The train ran on and on, and still I throned it in my corner,
awake or dreaming, indisputably master of all the things that
counted.&nbsp; The three aunts faded into antimacassars; the
little girl endured her uninteresting life and became an aunt and
an antimacassar in her turn, and still I swung my legs in my
corner seat, a boy-errant in the strange places of the
world.&nbsp; I do not remember the name of the station at which
the bearded guard <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>ultimately brought me out of my dreams.&nbsp; I do
remember standing stiffly on the platform and deciding that I had
been travelling night and day for three hundred years.&nbsp; When
I communicated this fact to the relatives who met me they were
strangely unimpressed; but I knew that when I returned home to my
brothers they would display a decent interest in the story of my
wanderings.&nbsp; After all, you can&rsquo;t expect grown-up
people to understand everything!</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>THE
MAGIC POOL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> born in a sceptical age,
heirs of a world that certainly took its Darwin too seriously, we
children did not readily enlarge the circle of our supernatural
acquaintances.&nbsp; There was the old witch who lived in the
two-storied house beyond the hill, in whom less discriminate eyes
recognised only the very respectable widow of an officer in the
India Army.&nbsp; There was the ghost of the murdered
shepherd-lad that haunted the ruined hut high up on the windy
downs; on gusty nights we heard him piping shrilly to his phantom
flocks, and sometimes their little bells seemed to greet us from
the chorus of the storm.&nbsp; There was a little drowned kitten
who mewed to us from the shadows of the rain-water cistern, and a
small boy who cried about the garden in the autumn because he
could not find his ball among the dead <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>leaves.&nbsp; We had all heard the
three last, and most of us had seen them at twilight-time, when
ghosts pluck up their poor thin courage and take their walks
abroad.&nbsp; As for the witch, we relied on our intuitions and
gave her house a wide berth.</p>
<p>The credentials of these four unquiet spirits having been
examined and found satisfactory, schoolroom opinion was against
any addition to their number.&nbsp; We would not accept my
younger brother&rsquo;s murderer carrying a sack or my little
sister&rsquo;s procession of special tortoises, though we
acknowledged that there was merit in them, regarded merely as
artistic conceptions.&nbsp; Perhaps, subconsciously, we realised
that to make the supernatural commonplace is also to make it
ineffective, and that there is no dignity in a life jostled by
spooks.&nbsp; At all events, we relied for our periodical panics
on those which had received the official sanction, and on the
terrifying monsters our imaginations had drawn from real
life&mdash;burglars, lunatics, and drunken men.</p>
<p>It was therefore noteworthy that as soon as we discovered the
pool in Hayward&rsquo;s <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Wood we were all agreed that it was
no ordinary sheet of water, but one of those enchanted pools
which draw their waters from magic sources and are capable of
throwing spells over mortals who approach them unwarily.&nbsp;
And yet, though we felt instinctively that there was something
queer about it, the pool in itself was not unattractive.&nbsp;
Held, as it were, in a cup in the heart of the wood, it still
contrived to win its share of sunshine through the branches
above.&nbsp; On its surface the water-boatmen were ferrying
cheerfully to and fro, while overhead the dragon-flies drove
their gaudy monoplanes in ceaseless competition.&nbsp; All about
the woods were gay with wild garlic and the little purple gloves
that Nature provides for foxes, and through a natural alley we
could see a golden meadow, where cups of cool butter were spread
with lavish generosity to quench the parched tongues of
bees.&nbsp; The mud that squelched under our feet as we stood on
the brink seemed to be good, honest mud, and gave our boots the
proper holiday finish.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we stared silently at
the waters, half-expecting <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to see them thicken and part in brown
foam, to allow some red-mouthed prehistoric monster to rise
oozily from his resting-place in the mud&mdash;some such mammoth
as we had seen carved in stone on the borders of the lake at the
Crystal Palace.&nbsp; But no monster appeared; only a rabbit
sprang up suddenly on the far side of the pool, and, seeing we
had no gun and no dog, limped off in a leisurely manner to the
warren.</p>
<p>After a while we grew weary of our doubts, and, tacitly
agreeing to pretend that it was only an ordinary pond, fell to
paddling in the shallows with a good heart.&nbsp; The mud slid
warmly through our toes, and the water lay round our calves like
a tight string, but we were not changed, as we had half
anticipated, into tadpoles or water-lilies.&nbsp; It was apparent
that the magic was of a subtler kind than this, and we splashed
about cheerfully until the inevitable happened and one of us went
in up to his waist.&nbsp; Then we sat on the bank nursing our wet
feet, and laughing at the victim as he ruefully wrung out his
clothes.&nbsp; We were all of a nautical turn of mind, and we
agreed that the pond would <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>serve very well for minor naval
engagements, though it was too sheltered to provide enough wind
for sailing-ships.&nbsp; Still, here we should at all events be
secure from such a disaster as had recently overtaken my
troopship <i>Dauntless</i>, which was cruising in calm weather on
Pickhurst Pond when all of a sudden &ldquo;a land breeze shook
the shrouds and she was overset,&rdquo; and four-and-twenty good
soldiers sank to the bottom like lead, which they were.&nbsp;
Regarded merely as an attractive piece of water, the pool could
not fail to be of service in our adventurous lives.</p>
<p>But all the time we felt in our hearts that it was something
more, though we would have found it hard to give reasons for our
conviction, for the pool seemed very well able to keep the secret
of its enchantment.&nbsp; We did not even know whether it was the
instrument of black magic or of white, whether its influence on
human beings was amiable or malevolent.&nbsp; We only knew that
it was under a spell, that beneath its reticent surface, that
showed nothing more than the reflection of our own inquiring
faces, lay hidden some part of that especial <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>magic that
makes the dreams of young people as real as life, and contradicts
the unlovely generalisations of disillusioned adults.&nbsp; All
that was necessary was to find the key that would unlock the
golden gates.</p>
<p>The brother who was nearest to me in terms of years found it
two days later, and came to me breathlessly with the news.&nbsp;
He had been reading a book of fairy stories, and had come upon
the description of just such a magic pool as ours, even to the
rabbit&mdash;who was, it seemed, a kind of advance-agent to the
spirit of the pool.&nbsp; The rules were very clear.&nbsp; All
you had to do was to go to the pool at midnight and wish aloud,
and your wish would be granted.&nbsp; If you were greedy enough
to wish more than once, you would be changed into a
goldfish.&nbsp; My brother thought it would be rather jolly to be
a goldfish, and so for a while did I; but on reflection we
decided that if the one wish were carefully expended it might be
more amusing to remain a boy.</p>
<p>It says something for our spirit of adventure that we did not
even discuss the advisability of undertaking this lawless <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>expedition.&nbsp; We were more engaged in rejoicing in
anticipation over the discomfiture of our elder brothers and
settling the difficult problem of what we should wish.&nbsp; My
brother was all for seven-league boots and invisible caps and
other conjuring tricks of a fa&euml;ry character; I had set my
heart on money, more sovereigns than we could carry, and I
finally brought my brother round to my point of view.&nbsp; After
all, he could always buy the other things if he had enough
money.&nbsp; It was agreed that he should wind up his birthday
watch and that we should only pretend to go to bed, as we should
have to start at half-past eleven.&nbsp; When planned by daylight
the whole thing seemed absurdly easy.</p>
<p>We had no difficulty in getting out of the house when the time
came, simply because this was not the sort of thing that the
grown-up people expected us to do, but we found the world
strangely altered.&nbsp; The familiar lanes had become rivers of
changing shadows, the hedgerows were ambuscades of robbers, the
tall trees were affronted giants.&nbsp; Fortunately, we were on
very good <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>terms with the moon at the time, so when she made her
periodical appearances from behind the scudding clouds she came
as a friend.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when my hand accidentally
touched my brother&rsquo;s in the dark it stayed there, and we
were glad to walk along hand in hand, a situation which we would
have thought deplorable for two fellows of our years by
day.&nbsp; It seemed to me that my brother was breathing shortly
and noisily as if he were excited, but presently the surprising
thought came to me that it might be my own breathing that I
heard.&nbsp; As we drew near to Hayward&rsquo;s Wood the moon
retired behind a cloud, and stayed there.&nbsp; This was hardly
friendly of her, for the wood was terribly dark, and the noise of
our own stumblings made us pause in alarm again and again.&nbsp;
When we stood still and listened all the trees seemed to be
saying &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow we reached the pool at last, and stayed our steps on
the bank expectantly.&nbsp; At first we could see nothing but
shadows, but, after a while, we discovered that it was full of
drowned stars, a little pale as though <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the water had extinguished some of
their fire.&nbsp; And then, as we wondered at this, the moon
shone through the branches overhead and lit the wood with a cool
and mysterious radiance that reminded me oddly of the
transformation scene in our last pantomime.&nbsp; My brother
pulled his watch out of his pocket, but his hand shook so that he
could hardly tell the time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five minutes
more,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.&nbsp; I tried to answer him,
and found that I could not speak.</p>
<p>And then, as we waited breathlessly, we heard a noise among
the undergrowth on the other side of the pool&mdash;a noise, it
seemed, of footsteps, that grew louder and louder in our excited
ears, till it was as if all the armies of the world were tramping
through the wood.&nbsp; And then . . . and then . . .</p>
<p>When we stopped to get our breath halfway home we first
discovered that neither of us had had presence of mind enough to
wish.&nbsp; But we knew that there was no going back.&nbsp; We
had had our chance, and missed it.&nbsp; But, even now, I do not
doubt that it was a magic pool.</p>
<h2><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>THE
STORY-TELLER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> changed with the seasons, and,
like the seasons, was welcome in every mood.&nbsp; In spring he
was forlorn and passionate in turn; now fiercely eloquent, now
tuneful with those little cheerful songs that seem in terms of
human emotion to be the saddest of all.&nbsp; In summer he
dreamed in sensuous and unambitious idleness, gladly conscious of
the sunshine and warm winds and flower-smells, and using only
languorous and gentle words.&nbsp; In autumn, with the dead
leaves of the world about his feet, he became strangely hopeful
and generous of glad promises of adventure and conquest.&nbsp; It
seemed as though he found it easier to triumph when Nature had
abdicated her jealous throne.&nbsp; But it was in the winter-time
when he came into his own kingdom, and mastered his environment
and his passions to make the most <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>joyful songs.&nbsp; Then he would lie
at full length on the hearthrug, and we children, sitting in a
rapt circle, fantastically lit by the fire, would listen to his
stories, and know that they were the authentic wisdom.</p>
<p>It was in vain that the grown-ups warned us against the
fascinations of his society, telling us that dreamers came to no
good end in a practical world.&nbsp; As well might the townsfolk
of Hamelin, in Brunswick, have ordered their children to turn a
deaf ear to the tune of the Pied Piper.&nbsp; We had studied life
from a practical point of view between our games, and found it
unsatisfying; this man brought us something infinitely more
desirable.&nbsp; He would come stepping with delicate feet,
fearful of trampling on our own tender dreams, and he would tell
us the enchanted stories that we had not heard since we were
born.&nbsp; He told us the meaning of the stars and the
significance of the sun and moon; and, listening to him, we
remembered that we had known it all once before in another
place.&nbsp; Sometimes even we would remind him of some trivial
incident that he had <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>forgotten, and then he would look at
us oddly and murmur sadly that he was getting very old.&nbsp;
When the stories were over, and all the room was still ringing
with beautiful echoes, he would stand erect and ask us fiercely
whether we saw any straws in his hair.&nbsp; We would climb up
him to look (for he was very tall), and when we told him that we
could not find any he would say: &ldquo;The day you see them
there will be no more stories.&rdquo;&nbsp; We knew what the
stories were worth to us, so we were always afraid of looking at
his head for fear that we should see the straws and all our
gladdest hours should be finished.</p>
<p>His voice was all the music extant, and it was only by
recalling it that our young ears could find that there was beauty
in fine singing and melodiousness in the chaunt of birds.&nbsp;
Yet when his words were eloquent we forgot the voice and the
speaker, content to sacrifice our critical individualities to his
inspiration till we were no more than dim and silent figures in
the background of his tale.&nbsp; It was only in winter-time that
he achieved this supreme illusion; perhaps the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>firelight
helped him, and the chill shadows of the world.&nbsp; In the
summer his stories had the witchery of dreams; their realism
startled us, and yet we knew that they were not real.&nbsp; After
listening to them through a hot afternoon we would stretch back
into consciousness, as though we had been asleep; his drowsy
fancies lulled our personalities, but did not conquer them.&nbsp;
The winter magic was of a rarer kind.&nbsp; Then even his
silences became significant, for he brought us to so close an
intimacy with his mind that his very thoughts seemed like
words.</p>
<p>It is idle to expect a child to believe that every grown-up
person was a child once upon a time, for it is not credible that
they could have forgotten so much.&nbsp; But this man was a child
both in feeling and in understanding.&nbsp; He knew the incidents
that perplexed us in those nursery legends that have become
classics, and sometimes it was his pleasure to tell them to us
again, having regard to our wakeful sympathies.&nbsp; He was the
friend of all the poor, lost creatures of romance&mdash;the
giants whose humiliating lot it was to be defeated by any
stripling lad, <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>the dragons whose flaming strength was a derision when
opposed to virtue in armour.&nbsp; He shared our pity for
Ant&aelig;us and Caliban and Goliath of Gath, and even treated
sorcerers and wicked kings with reasonable humanity.&nbsp;
Somehow, though we felt that it was wicked, we could not help
being sorry for people when they were punished very
severely.&nbsp; The very ease with which giants could be
outwitted suggested that the great simple fellows might prove
amiable enough if they were kindly treated, while it was always
possible that dragons might turn out to be bewitched princes, if
only the beautiful princesses would kiss them instead of sending
heroes to kill them unfairly, without giving them an opportunity
of explaining their motives.&nbsp; Our story-teller understood
our scruples and sympathised with them, and in his versions every
one had a chance, whether they were heroes or no.&nbsp; Even the
best children are sometimes cruel, but they are never half so
pitiless as the writers of fairy-stories.</p>
<p>But better than any fairy-stories were the stories that he
told us of our own lives, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>which under his touch became the
wonderful adventures which they really were.&nbsp; He showed us
that it was marvellous to get out of bed in the morning, and
marvellous to get into bed at night.&nbsp; He made us realise the
imaginative value of common things, and the fun that could be
derived even from the performance of duties, by aid of a little
make-believe.&nbsp; The grown-up folk would probably have derided
his system, but he made us tolerate our lessons, and endure the
pangs of toothache with some degree of fortitude.&nbsp; He had a
short way with the ugly bogies with which thoughtless nurses and
chance echoes from the horrors columns of newspapers had peopled
the shadows of our life.&nbsp; We were no longer afraid of the
dark when he had told us how friendly it could be to the
distressed.&nbsp; Hitherto we had vainly sought to find the
colours and sounds of romance in life, and, failing, had been
tempted to sum up the whole business as tedious.&nbsp; After he
had shown us how to do it, it was easy to see that life itself
was a story as romantic as we cared to make it.&nbsp; Our daily
official walks became <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>gallant expeditions, and we
approached arithmetic with a flaming sword.</p>
<p>Can any childhood ever have known a greater wizard than
this?&nbsp; And yet since that state does not endure for ever, it
must surely have happened to us to seek for straws in his
towering head once too often, had not death taken our kindly
enchanter from our company, and thus spared us the bitter
discovery that the one man who reconciled us to life was
considered rather more than eccentric by an obtuse world.&nbsp;
It is true that we noticed that the grown-up people were apt to
treat him sometimes as if he were one of us, but we felt that he
merited this distinction, and did not find it strange.&nbsp; Nor
did we wonder that he should tell stories aloud to himself
lacking a wider audience, for we knew that if we had the power we
should tell such stories to ourselves all day long.&nbsp; We did
not only fail to realise that he was mad; we knew that he was the
only reasonable creature of adult years who ever came near
us.&nbsp; He understood us and paid us the supreme compliment of
allowing us to understand him.&nbsp; The world called him <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>fantastic for
actions that convinced us that he was wise, and, thanks to a fate
that seemed at the time insensately cruel, the spell was never
broken.</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>ADMIRALS ALL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Christmas holidays are
over, and pantomimes and parties are cleared away, there is
usually a marked revival in a sport that has languished during
those exciting weeks.&nbsp; A child who wished to play at boats,
when the air was full of the smell of tangerine oranges and the
glamour of the footlights, would not be tolerated in any decent
schoolroom.&nbsp; But with the reappearance of lessons there
comes a sudden demand for walnut-shells and sealing-wax, and
bath-night, a thing undesirable while the house is noisy with new
tunes, becomes the cause of rivalry and passionate argument.</p>
<p>So at least it fell in the days when childhood was more than
the kernel of an article.&nbsp; The first symptom of the new
movement was an eager interest in dessert.&nbsp; We would entreat
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the
Olympians to forego nut-crackers and to use our new Christmas
pocket-knives for the purpose of opening their walnuts, and we
would regard the results with a keen and professional eye.&nbsp;
Were they destined to be clippers, yachts notable in history, or
mere utilitarian tubs to be laden with tipsy tin-soldiers and
sunk ignominiously by brass cannon?&nbsp; We were all naval
experts and our judgments were not often wrong.&nbsp; But even if
a walnut-shell had the right racing lines, there remained the
delicate operation of stepping the mast.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;blob&rdquo; of sealing-wax had to be dropped in exactly
the right place, and the whittled safety-match that served for a
mast must be truly perpendicular or the craft would be
lopsided.&nbsp; The paper sail was as large as safety would
permit.</p>
<p>There followed regattas in a basin filled to the brim with
water.&nbsp; The yachts raced from one side to the other, and
some one, assumed neutral, blew with a level breath across the
flood to supply the necessary wind.&nbsp; The reward of victory
was a little coloured flag that was gummed to the sail of the <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>successful
boat.&nbsp; On a memorable day my <i>Swallow</i> beat a hitherto
undefeated champion in my eldest brother&rsquo;s <i>Irene</i>, a
result the more astonishing that Irene&rsquo;s owner was himself
filling the r&ocirc;le of &AElig;olus.&nbsp; I am glad to think
it was Irene that was flung out of the window.</p>
<p>Apart from these classic contests there were secret trials and
naval reviews in private waters, and that intimate kind of
navigation that took place in one&rsquo;s bath.&nbsp; This last
was spiced with an agreeable element of risk, for a rash movement
would send the whole fleet to the bottom of the sea; but at the
same time in no other way could an admiral have the elements so
much under his control.&nbsp; Like Neptune, he could raise a
storm at will, and when the ships had battled gallantly against
terrible waves and icebergs of patent soap, a pair of pink feet
would rise above the surface of the ocean, and the Fortunate
Islands would greet the tired eyes of the mariners.&nbsp; It is a
fine thing to sail about the world, but it is very good to be at
home.</p>
<p>Later on, as the weather grew warmer, we <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>indulged in
more adventurous, and let it be admitted, more enjoyable,
sport.&nbsp; Walnut boats and paper junks ballasted with shot
might be well enough for the cold months or wet afternoons, but
when the summer called us out to play, our ambitious hearts
desired weightier craft than these.&nbsp; Then the yachts that
uncles had given us, which had been cruising peacefully on the
playroom floor during the indoor weeks, were brought out and
considered in their new aspect.&nbsp; There was always something
at once thrilling and disappointing about these stately
ships.&nbsp; The height of their masts, the intricacy of their
rigging, and the little lines that marked the planks of their
deck, filled us with pride, and made us seek the nearest pond
with quick, elated steps.&nbsp; But these things might be as well
admired indoors, and somehow these boats never sailed as well on
any wakeful pond as they did on the waters of our dreams.&nbsp;
There they were for ever tossing on the crests of enormous waves,
and all night long their great masts went crashing by the board;
but on Pickhurst Pond they behaved with a staid monotony, <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and while we
and the boats of our hands had as many moods as the spring, these
official craft were content to perform their business of sailing
with the conscientious precision of grown-up persons.</p>
<p>There was more to be said for the modest sort of boat you
would buy for sixpence or a shilling.&nbsp; They had a useless
mast and sail (the boat capsized if you set it), seats that were
annoying but easily removed, and sometimes, as a crowning piece
of Philistinism, oars!&nbsp; We would have scorned to give a
moment&rsquo;s consideration to a rowing boat at any time.&nbsp;
We wanted only craft that were fit to cruise with equal
adroitness on boundless oceans and unhealthy tropic rivers, and,
lacking a hold, where should we keep the rum and the pieces of
eight?&nbsp; But if you threw away everything but the bare hull,
and painted that black, you had a very sound basis for sensible
boat-building.&nbsp; A tin railway carriage would make a cabin, a
wooden brick the quarter-deck, and if you could find some lead
for the keel you might give the vessel a real mast with which to
strike the southern stars.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>But,
after all, the best boats were the boats we built entirely
ourselves.&nbsp; Our favourite materials were corks, empty
match-boxes, and such wood as lies within the scope of a
pocket-knife, and we would drive tintacks into the craft until it
looked like a nursery cake, crowned with burnt currants.&nbsp;
The resulting ships varied as to shape and size, but could be
trusted to conduct themselves in the water with a charming
eccentricity.&nbsp; Sometimes they seemed to skim the waves like
birds, sometimes the water leaped through them with a laugh, and
they sank down to join the minnows and the pebbles at the bottom
of the stream.&nbsp; In the latter case the owner would lie flat
on the bank with a sharp stone pressing into his chest, and feel
for the lost craft in the cold, slippery waters; for the rest of
the morning his shirt-sleeve would cling damply to his skin,
while the assembled experts considered the failure and made acute
suggestions.</p>
<p>The stream&mdash;we called it a river&mdash;on which we sailed
these ships passed in its cheerful course through an iron pipe,
and sometimes a vessel that had disappeared merrily under <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>the dark arch
would be seen no more of our eyes, though we waited at the other
end of the passage perilous until our bodies grew chill in our
sailor suits, and the mists came rolling up from the
water-meadows.&nbsp; It was easy to crouch down by the mouth of
the pipe, and hear the water lap-lapping in the dark against the
echoing sides of the tunnel, but our ears could tell us nothing,
and as we went home we would speculate in whispers as to the fate
of the missing vessel.&nbsp; Had it foundered on some treacherous
rock, or was there some mysterious outlet unknown to man, through
which it had escaped us?&nbsp; Even while we spoke it might be
nodding on merrily towards the night and the stars, through a
new, strange country that no one could find in daylight
fashion.</p>
<p>In truth, there was no game like this, appealing alike to mind
and body, and fraught with surprises and enchanting side-issues
of play.&nbsp; We might launch our vessel at dawn for Babylon,
and night would find it dreaming by some South Sea isle, or lying
a shattered wreck on the coast of Brazil.</p>
<p>Doubtless to the grown-up observer, who <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>had seen the
great sea dotted with little ships, our gutter mishaps and
adventures on puddles were of small importance.&nbsp; But as
becomes the children of an island race, we played this game with
a strange earnestness, and though our boats were small, we knew
that they were large enough for little boys to go roaming in
through the long day.&nbsp; And that was all that mattered.</p>
<h2><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>A
REPERTORY THEATRE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> most great movements in art,
it had but a modest beginning.&nbsp; On a memorable day one of my
brothers was looking in the window of a little toy-shop when he
discovered some of those fascinating sheets of characters to
which Stevenson has devoted a charming essay.&nbsp; He happened
to have money in his pocket (it was indeed a memorable day), and
he brought home his treasure-trove with the air of a capitalist
who has made a wise investment.&nbsp; Schoolroom society approved
his enterprise with enthusiasm.&nbsp; We knew nothing about
&ldquo;The Woodman&rsquo;s Hut,&rdquo; the play to which the
characters in question belonged; it was enough for us that these
figures of men and women were clearly messengers from the Land of
Romance, and their mysterious attitudes only added to the
interest with which we regarded <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>them.&nbsp; We got out our
paint-boxes, and, as unconsciously we were all
Post-Impressionists, we soon made them more mysterious still.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Stevenson remained satisfied with
this, which might be regarded as the costumier&rsquo;s work of
the model theatre, but we were more ambitious.&nbsp; Our first
theatre was a small packing-case without any sides, and in this
our characters, mounted on cardboard and supplied with firewood
supports, were quite contented to display their red legs and
green bodies.&nbsp; Our scenery was indicated rather than drawn
on brown paper with coloured chalks, and would, I think, have
pleased Mr. Gordon Craig.&nbsp; Two Christmas-tree candles served
for footlights, and, though we had no book of the words, we made
them up as we went along, and did very well.&nbsp; It was strange
how great a measure of illusion we achieved, although we
ourselves moved the puppets and spoke their lines.&nbsp; The
candles threw queer shadows across our faces, and it seemed as
though deeper voices than ours echoed in the room.&nbsp; We were
always being <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>astonished by the eerie products of our own imagination
when we were merely trying to amuse ourselves; and the effect of
our dramatic efforts was quite remote from anything that we had
intended.&nbsp; I understand that older dramatists sometimes
experience the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>Our activities could not long escape the criticism of the
grown-up people; but rather to our surprise, for candles were
quite illicit playthings, they contented themselves with a
general caution as to the perils of fire, and a particular
injunction concerning the dropping of candle-grease on the
tablecloth.&nbsp; So we played with our theatre till Christmas,
by which time the members of our stock company were more than a
little battered and weary at the knees.&nbsp; Then there came a
surprise.&nbsp; Included in the number of our presents were a
little theatre with a real curtain that went up and down, and
materials for three complete productions.&nbsp; This time we had
not only the characters, but the books of words and scenery as
well, and we prepared to do things on an unprecedented
scale.&nbsp; As a result, after <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>extraordinary labour in the scenic
and costume departments, we were able to produce, on three
successive nights, &ldquo;Paul Clifford,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Corsican Brothers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Miller and his
Men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The repertory theatre was fairly under way.</p>
<p>First-nights were really thrilling in those days.&nbsp; The
dignified deportment of our actors, as yet unspoiled by success,
roused the audience to enthusiasm, and we did not weary of
admiring simple stage effects that would have moved us to
scornful laughter in after-days.&nbsp; Yet even in these early
productions there lurked the seeds of artistic disruption.&nbsp;
Already our appreciation of the gallant bearing of Paul Clifford
passed all reasonable bounds, and threatened to develop into that
hero-worship that proves fatal to the talents of any actor.&nbsp;
Already we had an unwholesome craving for excessive realism in
the staging of plays, and we made use of the ingenuity of our
elders to drive Grindoff&rsquo;s sinister windmill in the first
act of &ldquo;The Miller and his Men.&rdquo;&nbsp; It might be
said that our theatre, <i>qu&acirc;</i> repertory theatre, was
doomed from the start.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>Nevertheless, at least two seasons of good work were
accomplished before our morbid imitation of Nature and the
illimitable egotism of Paul Clifford finally succeeded in driving
art from the stage.&nbsp; During that period we produced about
fifteen new plays, and gave a large number of one-night
revivals.&nbsp; Our repertory ranged from &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Dick Whittington,&rdquo; and I think one pleased us as
much as the other.&nbsp; This would have been more remarkable if
Paul Clifford had not played the title-part in both plays.&nbsp;
We had soon come to prefer him to any other of the heroes, and in
consequence, whatever the play might be, he was bound to be there
in his riding-boots and handsome yellow satin coat.&nbsp; This
would have been well enough if he had been willing to keep his
place, but he soon became as ubiquitous as an
actor-manager.&nbsp; Owing to the number of r&ocirc;les that he
was called upon to fill, we had his pasteboard presentment in a
hundred different attitudes, and on one occasion when a
stage-crowd was required it was entirely composed of Paul
Cliffords, and even then there were rows of <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>forlorn Paul
Cliffords in the wings for whom there was no room on the
stage.&nbsp; This was the beginning of the end.&nbsp; We suffered
from the worst excesses of the star system; we began to be
discontented when Paul was not on the stage, and we were prepared
to boo if that dashing highwayman was not permitted to bluster
across the most subtle dramas.</p>
<p>About this time we deserted the old theatre that had been the
scene of so many triumphs for a larger and far more elaborate
one.&nbsp; We had long had gas footlights, but now our system of
lighting was intricate enough to suit Mr. Arthur Collins.&nbsp;
Indeed, when, years afterwards, I was allowed to explore the
stage of Drury Lane, I found nothing to surprise me, save,
perhaps, the electric switchboard, with its pretty display of
diminutive electric lights.&nbsp; Our scenic sensations were only
surpassed by those of Mr. Bruce Smith.&nbsp; When we played a
dramatisation of &ldquo;Hard Cash,&rdquo; the scuttled vessel
sank in a sea of real water.&nbsp; The fountains in our Garden of
Enchantment flung scented torrents into their moss-clad basins;
and <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>when
we sought to reproduce a burning house we succeeded in setting
the theatre on fire.</p>
<p>It will be understood that by that time we had come to rely on
the grown-up people for assistance in producing plays, and we had
substituted their perverted adult taste for our juvenile
conceptions of drama.&nbsp; The old plays, with their homely
characters and dignified simplicity of setting, no longer pleased
us.&nbsp; We craved for a debauch of Paul Clifford, and every new
production had to be more elaborate in its insentient mimicry of
life than the one before.&nbsp; The inevitable happened.&nbsp;
The more our stage-setting approximated to Nature, and the more
Paul pirouetted in the limelight, the less we attained to that
illusion which had been so easy to achieve on a packing-case
stage with two little coloured candles for footlights.&nbsp;
There came a day when Paul no longer interested us, and we felt
that we had exhausted the possibilities of the sensational.&nbsp;
The theatre was closed, and when, many months afterwards, a vague
curiosity led us to ask what had become of it, we <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>learnt with
but little regret that our elders had given it away to some
little boy whose taste in drama was as yet unsophisticated.&nbsp;
I wonder what he made of our real sea and our practicable
fountains!</p>
<p>Not very long ago I was turning over some old books, when a
small piece of cardboard slipped from between the pages and fell
to the ground.&nbsp; It was in the likeness of a man, a man
dressed in riding-boots and yellow satin; yet it was some moments
before I realised that I was in the presence of the once great
Paul Clifford.&nbsp; With recognition came something like
remorse.&nbsp; It was no more than just to forgive his faults
after so many years, and he really was a very good actor until an
excess of praise turned his little pasteboard head.</p>
<p>I looked round the library, and after due consideration took a
volume of the Laureate&rsquo;s poems from the shelves, and laid
the tired highwayman to rest between its pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep on, brave Paul!&rdquo; I said softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No one will ever disturb you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now I have written his epitaph.</p>

49</span>CHILDREN AND THE SPRING</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Poets</span> and careless, happy fellows
like that may say what they like for the spring, but there are
only two seasons in the year for children.&nbsp; The parties of
Christmas appealed to our senses in a hundred pleasant
ways.&nbsp; They shone with Jack Frost and Chinese lanterns and
the gay gelatine from crackers; they compressed our limbs in the
pride of new, uncomfortable suits and tight, shiny shoes; they
tasted of burnt raisins and orange jelly; they sang with frosty
carols and sensible tunes and the agreeable din of penny musical
instruments; they smelt of Christmas-tree candles and tangerine
oranges.&nbsp; Then there were pantomimes and large silver pieces
from the pockets of millionaire uncles, and if all else failed,
the possibility of snow.&nbsp; Certainly there was nothing the
matter with winter.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Summer,
too, had its fierce, immeasurable joys.&nbsp; This was the season
of outdoor sports, hunting and boating and digging holes to New
Zealand.&nbsp; There was cricket, real cricket, which means that
you are out if you hit the ball into the next garden, and that
you stop playing if you break a window, and there was hurling of
javelins in wild shrubberies, and dabbling in silver brooks for
elusive minnows.&nbsp; Later there would come long, adventurous
journeys in railway-trains, when, like wise travellers, we would
cuddle provisions of buns and pears and tepid sandwiches in our
laps.&nbsp; Our legs would be so stiff when we reached our
destination that we would totter on the platform like old men,
and our eyes would be weary with watching the fleeting
world.&nbsp; But as the cab crept up the gritty hills we would
see the ocean waiting for us to come and play with it, and
everything else in life would be forgotten.&nbsp; The country,
with its apple-trees and its pigs and its secret places, was not
to be despised, but it was the sea that led us home to our
dreams.</p>
<p>Yet possibly the finest thing that the <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>summer had to
give us was the healthy, joyous sense of fatigue that comes from
games.&nbsp; It was pleasant to drop on the lawn when cricket was
over, and stay there, not wholly displeased with the scent of the
flowers, looking into the blue sky until the gnats drove you in
to tea.&nbsp; It was pleasant to lie on the beach, with the heat
creeping up and down your face, and to let the sand trickle
through your fingers, while the long waves whispered out to
sea.&nbsp; It was pleasant to drowse in the hay after hunting
buffaloes all the sunny afternoon.&nbsp; It was only at such
moments, when the air had a savour of sleep, that we really felt
conscious of youth as a desirable possession.</p>
<p>A child&rsquo;s year would be divided abruptly into winter and
summer, for youth is impatient of compromise, but as things are,
there are spring and autumn to be reckoned with.&nbsp; For
autumn, there is not much to be said.&nbsp; There were nuts and
blackberries, and the sweet-scented fallen leaves, in which we
would paddle up to our knees.&nbsp; But the seaside brown was
wearing off our legs, and night came so soon and with so harsh
and <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>boisterous a note.&nbsp; It was not bad when we happened
to be feeling very brave to lie awake at night and hear the
branches screaming when the wind hurt them.&nbsp; The sheer
discomfort of the outer world made bed delicious.&nbsp; But the
necessary courage for this point of view was rare, and normally
we would wish the nights quieter and less exciting.&nbsp; The
autumn wind was for ever fumbling at our nursery windows like a
burglar, or creeping along the passages like a supernatural
thing.&nbsp; Sometimes our hearts stopped beating while we
listened.</p>
<p>But of all the seasons of the year, spring is most oppressive
to the spirit of childhood.&nbsp; The dear, artificial things
that had made the winter lovely were gone, and the pastoral
delights of the summer were still to come, yet Nature called us
forth to a muddy, unfinished world.&nbsp; Then was the season of
the official walk, a dreary traffic on nice, clean pavements,
that placed everything in the world worth walking to out of
bounds.&nbsp; A cold wind without the compensating advantage of
snow would swing round the corners of streets, and we would feel
as if <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>we
were wearing the ears and noses of other people.&nbsp; When we
were not quarrelling we were sulking, and each was equally fatal,
for the Olympians only needed a pretext to make our days bitter
with iron and quinine.&nbsp; And our quarrels, that at kinder
seasons of the year were the regretted accidents of moments,
lingered now from day to day, and became the source of fierce and
lonely pride.&nbsp; If one of us, released for a minute from the
wearing of the world&rsquo;s woes, made timid efforts to arrange
a concerted game, he would become the object of general
suspicion, and his sociability would be regarded as a
hypocritical effort to win the favour of the grown-up folk.&nbsp;
The correct attitude was one of surly aloofness that spluttered
once or twice a day into tearful rebellion against the
interference of the authorities.&nbsp; It is insulting to give a
man medicine when he tells you that he wishes he were dead.</p>
<p>Of course, underlying these disorders was just that dim spirit
of disquiet that has made this season of the year notable for the
production of lyric poetry.&nbsp; We had no means of expressing
the thing that troubled <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>our blood.&nbsp; Indeed, we ourselves
did not know what was the matter, though this ignorance did not
make our discomfort less.&nbsp; Time, who in the glare of a
Christmas party or on the shore of a summer sea could run faster
than we, seemed to take a spiteful pleasure in lingering in this
unattractive place.&nbsp; And although our attitude towards life
appeared to have been determined for us by Fate, when the long
day ended and we thought over things in bed, we had not even the
satisfaction of being proud of our day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; We
would vow silently to our pillows that things should go better
to-morrow, but alas! there might be many morrows before summer
brought peace to our blood.</p>
<p>It is not only children whom the spring winds stir to madness,
but a man has striven but poorly if he cannot contrive to bear in
patience with this vernal torment of living, or even to turn it
to some useful purpose in his work.&nbsp; But children, who can
only express themselves in their play, must pay for the joys of
the coming summer in moods speechless and almost too bitter for
their <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>years.&nbsp; In sympathy with all the green, quick
things of Nature, their blood is in a state of passionate unrest
for which their minds can supply no adequate reason, and they are
unhappy in consequence.&nbsp; But I am far from blaming the
Olympians for the attitude they adopted in this difficult
business.&nbsp; They kept a wise eye on our health, and if our
naughtiness became outrageous, we were punished.&nbsp; For the
rest, as they could not give us lips of silver and a pipe of gold
with which to chant the amazing gladness of the spring, I do not
see what they could do.</p>
<h2><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>ON
NURSERY CUPBOARDS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were deep and wide and tall,
and filled as to the lower shelves with a number of objects which
no child of spirit could find interesting any longer.&nbsp; Here
were the battered fragments of the presents of bygone birthdays,
of which the true ownership was dubious, because we none of us
would confess that we had ever been young enough to receive such
childish gifts.&nbsp; Here also were foolish trifles from
forgotten Christmas-trees, useless objects employed by the
fraudulent to give their trees a deceitful appearance of
wealth.&nbsp; Then there were the presents that were too useful:
the elevating gifts of aunts and the improving offerings of
god-parents, things that either trespassed on the arid land of
lessons or presumed some grown-up virtue which the recipient
neither had nor coveted.&nbsp; The Olympians <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>would refer
to these dull possessions in the aggregate as &ldquo;the
children&rsquo;s toys&rdquo;; but we knew better.&nbsp; Our true
treasures, the things we loved, never saw the inside of that
unromantic depository save through the thoughtless tidying of our
rulers.&nbsp; The works of watches and mechanical toys, our
soldiers and cannon of brass, our fleet of walnut boats and empty
cartridge-cases&mdash;these things and their brothers slept under
our pillows or in the very private cardboard boot-box under the
bed.&nbsp; By day those that were being employed were spread
about the floor or strained our pockets to bursting-point.&nbsp;
The people who were too old to know any better referred to them
contemptuously as &ldquo;rubbish,&rdquo; a word we privately
reserved for their aggravating presents.&nbsp; And though the
long interval that separated dinner and tea on wet days might
weary us of our immediate jewels, it was not in the cupboard that
we sought relief from Boredom.&nbsp; It is true that now and
again some Gentleman Adventurer would climb on a chair and
investigate the shelves that were supposed to be beyond <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>our reach, to
return with piratical spoil of matches and cotton and citrate of
magnesia, a cate that tingles pleasantly on the tongue of
youth.&nbsp; But even from this point of view it could not
compare with the rich cupboards of the kitchen and the
dining-room, those Meccas of piracy that filled our dreams with
monstrous raisins and pickled onions, a successful pilgrimage to
which would assure a man the admiring homage of his comrades for
days to come.</p>
<p>In short, we were content to regard the toy-cupboard as a
harmless hobby of the grown-up people, and we were not far
wrong.&nbsp; It was not for them to understand that one general
cupboard could not hold the real treasures of four children,
whose sense of possession was keen even to the point of
battle.&nbsp; It was a dustbin for toys that had been found out,
and we would have scorned to display its sordid contents to our
friends.&nbsp; To them, if they were worthy, were revealed the
true mysteries, the things that we fought for and made into
dreams, the sun and moon and stars of our imaginative
heaven.&nbsp; Sentimental elders might greet it with tears for <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>their lost
youth if they wished; we received their congratulations calmly,
and kept our pity for their insanity to ourselves.</p>
<p>In truth, the thing was a symbol for all our relations with
grown-up people.&nbsp; They always seemed so sensible and yet
they could not understand.&nbsp; If we fell off the banisters on
to our heads they would overwhelm us with sympathy, when every
one knows that a big lump on the head is a thing to be proud
of.&nbsp; But if a well-meaning aunt insisted on reading to us
for a whole afternoon in the horse-chestnut season we were
expected, and even commanded, to be grateful for this undesired
favour.&nbsp; And so it was in the matter of toys.&nbsp;
Sometimes, by accident as it were, they gave us sensible things
that we really wanted.&nbsp; But as a rule their presents were
concrete things that gave our imaginations no chance.&nbsp; We
only wanted something to make a &ldquo;think&rdquo; about, but
few of the official presents were suitable for this
purpose.&nbsp; One of the gifts that delighted me most as a child
was a blue glass dish, large and shallow.&nbsp; Filled with water
it became a real blue sea, very proper for <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>the
navigation of smaller craft.&nbsp; Empty and subverted it became
the dome of an azure city.&nbsp; And holding it before my eyes I
would see a blue world, a place the existence of which I had
previously only suspected.&nbsp; An ocean, a city, and a world
combine to make a better present than a commonplace toy.&nbsp;
Once in a blue moon I have seen strange sights, and something of
the glamour of that dish is with me even now.</p>
<p>Naturally, in course of time an uncommon significance became
attached to such things as this, and I should have no more
thought of keeping my blue sea in the same cupboard as my
brother&rsquo;s maxim gun than he would have allowed that
excellent weapon to be the bedfellow of my sister&rsquo;s famous
one-legged nigger doll.&nbsp; We realised far better than our
elders the meaning of their favourite shibboleth, &ldquo;a place
for everything&rdquo;; we knew that the sea air would rust a
cannon, and that poor Dorothy could swim but poorly with her one
dusky leg.&nbsp; So we tacitly left the cupboard as a place
wherein the grown-ups could keep the toys <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>they gave us
to please themselves, and found exclusive and more sympathetic
hiding-places for our treasures.&nbsp; Now and again a toy might
pass through both stages of existence.&nbsp; Mechanical toys did
not amuse us at all, until the donors were tired of playing with
them, and we might pull them to pieces and make them our very
own.&nbsp; And the costly gifts of uncles were useless until the
authorities had ceased to see that we took care of them.&nbsp;
But these doubtful cases apart, we would divide our presents into
their respective groups as soon as we had removed the
wrappings.&nbsp; &ldquo;This and this can go into the cupboard,
but this shall go to bed with me to-night!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
not the person who &ldquo;understands&rdquo; children who was
most fortunate in the choice of gifts.</p>
<p>For the rest, with unconscious satire, we constituted the
toy-cupboard the state prison of the nursery.&nbsp; Refractory
dolls and kittens, and soldiers awaiting court-martial, repented
their crimes in its depressing gloom, and this was really the
only share it had in our amusements.&nbsp; Beyond that it stood
merely for official &ldquo;play,&rdquo; a melancholy traffic in
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>which we
never indulged.&nbsp; Its shelves were crowded with the illusions
of grown-up people, and, if we considered it at all, it was in
the same aspect in which we were wont to regard them.&nbsp; They
were obviously well-meaning, but somehow or other they lacked
understanding, and the nursery cupboard was full in
consequence.</p>
<h2><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>THE
FAT MAN</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">met</span> him first at Lord&rsquo;s,
the best place, perhaps, in all London for making acquaintances
and even friends.&nbsp; Even if he had not worn a light suit of
clothes that drew the critical eye inevitably to his monstrous
girth he would have been conspicuous as occupying with difficulty
the space provided for two persons on an afternoon when seats
were at a premium.&nbsp; But though I own to no prejudice against
flesh in itself, it was not his notable presence that induced me
to speak to him, but rather the appealing glances that he threw
to right and left of him when he thought to have detected that
fine wine of the game which, tasted socially, changes a cricket
match to a rare and solemn festival.&nbsp; Such an invitation is
one that no one for whom cricket is an inspiration can refuse,
and it was natural that thereafter we should <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>praise and
criticise in wise and sympathetic chorus.</p>
<p>The acquaintance thus begun warmed to intimacy at the Oval and
Canterbury, and I began to seek his easily recognisable figure on
cricket-grounds with eagerness, to feel a pang of disappointment
if he was not there.&nbsp; For though to his careless eye his
great moonlike face might suggest no more than good-natured
stupidity, I had soon discovered that this exuberance of form
barely concealed a delicate and engaging personality, that within
those vast galleries of flesh there roamed the timid spirit of a
little child.&nbsp; I have said that to the uncritical his face
might seem wanting in intelligence, but it was rather that the
normal placidity of his features suggested a lack of emotional
sensitiveness.&nbsp; Save with his eyes&mdash;and it needed
experience to read their message&mdash;he had no means of
expressing his minor emotions, no compromise between his wonted
serenity and the monstrous phenomenon of his laughter, that
induced a facial metamorphosis almost too startling to convey an
impression of mirth.&nbsp; If normally his face <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>might be
compared with a deep, still pool, laughter may be said to have
stirred it up with a stick, and the consequent ripples seemed to
roll to the very extremities of his body, growing in force as
they went, so that his hands and feet vibrated in humorous
ecstasy.</p>
<p>Later, when, in one of his quaint interrogative moods, he
showed me a photograph of himself as a child, I was able to give
form to the charming spirit that Nature had burdened with this
grievous load.&nbsp; I saw the picture of a strikingly handsome
little boy, with dark, wide eyes and slightly parted lips that
alike told of a noble sense of wonder.&nbsp; This, I felt, was
the man I knew, whose connection with that monstrous shape of
flesh had been so difficult to trace.&nbsp; Yet strangely I could
recognise the features of the boy in the expansive areas of the
man.&nbsp; In the light of the photograph he resembled one of
those great cabbage-roses that a too lavish season has swollen
beyond all flowerlike proportions, yet which are none the less
undeniably roses.&nbsp; Others might find him clumsy,
elephantine, colossal; thenceforward he was for me clearly
boyish.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>His
voice varied more in tone and quality than that of any other man
I have ever met, and over these variations he seemed to have
little control; and this, too, made it very difficult for
strangers to detect the trippings and hesitancies, gentle,
wayward, and infinitely sensitive, of his childlike
temperament.&nbsp; Within the limits of one simple utterance he
would achieve sounds resembling the drumming of sudden rain on
galvanised iron and the ecstatic whistlings of dew-drunk
birds.&nbsp; It was sometimes difficult to follow the purport of
his speech for sheer wonder at the sounds that slid and leaped
and burst from his lips.&nbsp; His voice reminded me of a child
strumming on some strange musical instrument of extraordinary
range and capacity which it had not learned how to play.&nbsp;
His laughter was ventriloquial and rarely bore any accountable
relationship to the expressions of mirth of ordinary men.&nbsp;
It was like an explosive rendering of one of those florid scales
dear to piano-tuners, but sometimes it suggested rather an
earthquake in his boots.</p>
<p>He dwelt in a little flat that seemed like <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the upper
floor of a doll&rsquo;s-house when related to its proprietor, and
here it was his delight to dispense a hospitality charmingly
individual.&nbsp; His meals recalled nothing so much as the
illicit feasts held in school dormitories, and when he peered
curiously into his own cupboards he always looked as if he were
about to steal jam.&nbsp; He would produce viand after viand with
the glee of a successful explorer, and in terms of his eager
hospitality the most bizarre cates appeared congruous and even
intimately connected, so that at his board grown men would eat
like schoolboys, with the great careless appetite of youth.</p>
<p>He had a fine library and a still finer collection of
mechanical toys, which were for him a passion and a
delight.&nbsp; It was pleasant to see him set some painted piece
of clockwork careering on the hearthrug, stooping over it
tenderly, with wondering eyes, and hands intent to guard it from
disaster.&nbsp; It was pleasant, too, to hear him recite
Swinburne, of whom he was a passionate admirer; for, though his
voice would be as rebellious as ever, his whole <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>body would
thrill and pulse with the music of the poet.&nbsp; He always
touched books softly because he loved them.&nbsp; Of bonfires he
spoke reverently, though a London flat hardly lent itself to
their active exploitation; and I remember that he told me once
that nothing gave him a keener sense of what he had lost in
growing up than the scent of burning twigs and leaves.&nbsp; Yet
if he felt this loss, what should it have been for us who had
come so much farther than he!</p>
<p>Himself a child, he was beloved of children and treated by
them as an equal; but I never knew another child who was so
easily and continuously amused.&nbsp; The Hippodrome, the British
Museum, the Tower of London, and the art of Messrs. Maskelyne and
Devant alike raised in him the highest enthusiasm, which he
expressed with charming but sometimes embarrassing freedom.&nbsp;
Alone of all men, perhaps, he found the Royal Academy wholly
satisfying, and it could be said of him truly that if he did not
admire the picture he would always like the frame.&nbsp; He had a
huge admiration for any one who did anything, and he liked riding
in lifts.</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Though
he treated women with elaborate courtesy, their society made him
self-conscious, and he, who could direct his body featly enough
in a crowded street, was apt to be clumsy in drawing-rooms.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was for this reason that they had apparently played no
marked part in his life, and I may be wrong in attaching any
special significance to a phrase he made one quiet evening in his
flat.&nbsp; We had been speaking of the latest sensation in our
group of mutual acquaintances, of the marriage of Phyllis,
daintiest and most witty of cricket-lovers, to a man in whom the
jealously critical eyes of her friends could perceive no charm;
but the conversation had dwindled to silence when he said,
&ldquo;Surely his love can make any man lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if the subject were closed, he fell to speaking of
his latest pocket-knife with boyish animation; but the phrase
dwelt in my mind, though the image of the brave boy with wide
eyes and lips parted in wonder was all that I ever knew of the
man who made it.</p>
<h2><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>CAROL
SINGERS</h2>
<p>When we were boys there was no part of the Christmas
festivities to which we looked forward more eagerly than the
singing of carols from house to house on Christmas Eve.&nbsp; If
the night fell wild and rainy, we had to abandon our tuneful
journey and content ourselves with singing indoors.&nbsp; But if
it was a dry night, we set forth joyfully, even though a
disquieted moon and inattentive stars foretold a wet
Christmas.&nbsp; Our hearts were lighter than men&rsquo;s hearts
can be, as we clattered down the lanes, fortified by a hot supper
and possibly a scalding tumblerful of mulled claret.&nbsp; We
would always start at the houses of friends, and then, made bold
by success, we would sing our glad tidings to any house which had
a lit window.&nbsp; For the credit of human nature it may be said
that we were made welcome <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>wherever we went.&nbsp; Sometimes
people offered us money, which our code forbade us to accept,
though we should have liked it well enough; more frequently we
were asked to come in and have something to eat or drink, offers
with which even the infinite capacity of youth could by no means
cope.&nbsp; If the night was frosty it was pleasant to toast
ourselves for a minute or two in front of the fire before going
out again into a world of frozen ruts, sparkling hedgerows, and
mysterious shadows, wherein we felt ourselves veritable figures
of romance.</p>
<p>And, indeed, we ourselves sang better than we knew.&nbsp;
However cheerfully and noisily we might undertake the expedition,
it was not long before we became aware that other spirits were
abroad.&nbsp; The simple words and merry tunes which we sang
suddenly became wonderfully significant.&nbsp; Between the verses
we heard the sheep calling on far hills while the shepherd kings
rode down to Bethlehem with their gifts.&nbsp; The trees and
fields and houses took up the chant, and our noises were blended
with that deep song of the Universe which the new ears of the
young <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>hear
so often and so clearly.&nbsp; When our carol was over there
would fall a great silence that seemed to our quickened senses to
be but a gentler and sweeter music of hope and joy.&nbsp; As we
passed from one house to the next we spoke to each other in
whispers for fear we should break the spell that held the night
enchanted.&nbsp; Even as we heard other noises when we sang, so
now we heard the sound of other feet that trod the same glad road
as our own.&nbsp; From being a half-dozen of little boys come out
to have some fun on Christmas eve, we had become a small section
of a great army.&nbsp; Tramp, tramp, the joyful feet fell before
and behind us along the road, and when we stopped to sing, the
whole night thrilled into a triumphant ecstasy of song.&nbsp; On
such nights the very earth, it seemed, sang carols.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, our vivid recollection of the glories of those
memorable Christmas Eves that leads us to be gentle with the
little boys and girls who sing at our door to-night.&nbsp; We
have all listened to the eloquent persons who can prove that
Christmas is not what it used to be.&nbsp; They point to the
decadence <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>of pantomime, the decay of the waits and mummers, and
the democratic impudence of those who demand
Christmas-boxes.&nbsp; Well, it may be&mdash;but children do like
modern pantomimes in spite of the generalisations of critics; and
though a Salvation Army band is an unpicturesque substitute for
such a village orchestra as is described in &ldquo;Under the
Greenwood Tree,&rdquo; it at least satisfies the ear of the
sentimentalist at two o&rsquo;clock of a frosty morning.&nbsp;
That Christmas-boxes are a nuisance is no new discovery.&nbsp; We
find Swift grumbling to Stella about them exactly two hundred
years ago.&nbsp; Mummers, we are told, are still to be found in
the country; five years back we saw them ourselves and were
satisfied that they had learnt their rather obscure rhymes from
their fathers before them, and not from any well-meaning society
for faking old customs.</p>
<p>This said, it must be admitted that carol-singers are not what
they were.&nbsp; Of the long procession of ragged children who
have sung &ldquo;While shepherds watched their flocks by
night&rdquo; at our gate this December, not one had taken the
trouble to learn either <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>the words or the tune
accurately.&nbsp; When asked to sing some other carol they broke
down, and it was apparent that they were trusting to their hungry
and thinly clad appearance rather than to their singing as a
means to obtain alms from the charitable.&nbsp;
Sometimes&mdash;this we fear is really a modern note&mdash;the
father was waiting in the background to collect the
takings!&nbsp; It is rather difficult to know what to do in such
cases, for the children may be punished if they are not
successful; and yet the practice of sending insufficiently clad
children into the streets on a winter&rsquo;s night is hardly to
be encouraged.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though the abuse is manifest, we would hesitate
to say that the custom of singing carols at our doors should be
stopped.&nbsp; It is difficult to read the heart of a child
aright, but it seems to us at least possible that a few of the
children win more than a mere handful of pennies from their
singing.&nbsp; Though they mumble their words to a tune they only
half remember, it is not likely that the spirit that made
wonderful the Christmas Eves of long ago shall <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>altogether
pass them by.&nbsp; Surely the night conspires with lights of the
world to enchant them, and for their own ears their voices
achieve beauty beyond the measure of mortal song.</p>
<p>In truth, this is a dream that we can ill afford to
spare.&nbsp; It seems a pity, however, that the children are not
taught carol-singing at school, especially as they are now often
taught, to our great content, the old games and dances.&nbsp;
Many of the older carols are really beautiful, both in the homely
simplicity of their words and in the unaffected charm of the airs
to which they are set.&nbsp; The desire of the average child for
song is extraordinary&mdash;as extraordinary, perhaps, as the
regrettable contempt of the average adult for poetry.&nbsp; Last
year we were present at the dress rehearsal of the pantomime at
Drury Lane, and we heard a theatreful of poor children sing the
music-hall ditties of the hour with wonderful spirit and
intensity.&nbsp; Our emotions were mixed.&nbsp; Mingled with the
natural pleasure that they should be enjoying themselves was
something of regret for the sad lives that so small a <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>treat should
rouse to ecstasy.&nbsp; Afterwards we felt sorry that the
children had nothing better to sing.&nbsp; We have no prejudice
against music-hall songs in general.&nbsp; They are not as
intelligent as they might be, but they serve their time in
pleasing, harmlessly enough, a number of people who also are not
as intelligent as they might be.&nbsp; But somehow the lyres of
little singing children deserve better fare than this.&nbsp; We
look forward to a time when they will have it.</p>
<h2><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>THE
MAGIC CARPET</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were two rugs in the library,
and for some time we used to dispute the vexed question of their
relative merits.&nbsp; &AElig;sthetically, there was something to
be said for both of them.&nbsp; The rug that stood by the
writing-desk from which father wrote to the newspapers was soft
and furry; indeed, it was almost as pleasant a couch as the sofa
with the soft cushions in the drawing-room, which was
taboo.&nbsp; Moreover, it lent itself very readily to such
fashionable winter sport as bear-hunting, providing as it did a
trackless prairie, a dangerous marsh, or the quarry itself as the
adventure required.&nbsp; The joys of the other rug were of a
calmer kind, and were, perhaps, chiefly due to its advantageous
position before the fire.&nbsp; It was pleasant to toast oneself
on a winter evening and trace with idle fingers <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the agreeable
deviations of its pattern.&nbsp; Sometimes it might be the ground
plan of a make-up city, with forts and sweet-shops and palaces
for our friends; sometimes it would be a maze, and we would
pursue, with bated breath, the vaulted passages that led to the
dread lair of the Minotaur.&nbsp; But such plots as these were of
passive, rather than active, interest.&nbsp; Reviewing the
argument dispassionately, Fenimore Cooper may have had a slight
advantage over Nathaniel Hawthorne; bear-hunting may have been a
little more popular than the dim excitements of Greek myth.</p>
<p>But while the discussion was at its height, there dawned in
the East the sun that was to prove fatal to Perseus and the
Deerslayer alike.&nbsp; I do not know from which of our uncles
&ldquo;The Arabian Nights&rdquo; first came to an enraptured
audience; but I am sure that an uncle must have been responsible
for its coming, for as a gift it was avuncular in its
splendour.&nbsp; We quickly realised that the world had changed,
and took the necessary steps to welcome our new guest.&nbsp; The
old lamp in the hall that had graced the illicit <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>doings of
pirates and smugglers in the past was thenceforward the property
of Aladdin; a strange bottle that had been Crusoe&rsquo;s served
to confine the unfortunate genie; and with quickening pulses we
discovered that in the fireside rug we possessed no less a
treasure than the original magic carpet.</p>
<p>I must explain that we were not like those fortunate children
of whom Miss Nesbit writes with such humorous charm.&nbsp; To us
there fell no tremendous adventures; we might polish
Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp till it shone like the moon without gaining
a single concrete acid-drop for our pains.&nbsp; But the
&ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; gave us all that we ever thought of
seeking either in books or toys in those uncritical days&mdash;a
starting-point for our dreams.&nbsp; And this, I take it, is the
best thing that a writer can give a child, and it was for lack of
this that we considered the works of Lewis Carroll silly, while
finding one of the books of Miss Molesworth&mdash;I wish I could
recall its name&mdash;a masterpiece of fancy and erudition.</p>
<p>So when the din of the schoolroom did not suit my mood, or the
authorities were <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>unduly didactic, I would slip away to the twilit library
and guide the magic carpet through the delicate meadows of my
dreams.&nbsp; The fire would blaze and crackle in the grate and
fill my eyes with tears, so that it was easy to fancy myself in a
sparkling world of sunshine.&nbsp; And from the shadows of the
room little creatures would creep out to touch my glowing cheeks
with cool, soft fingers, or to pluck timidly at the sleeve of my
coat.&nbsp; I did not endeavour to give these shy companions of
the dark any definite place in my universe.&nbsp; Their
sympathetic reticence was reassuring in that room of great
leaping shadows, and I was glad that they should keep me company
in the blackness, a thing so terrible when I woke up at night in
my bed.&nbsp; Sometimes, perhaps, I wondered how they could bear
to live in the place where nightmare was; but for the rest I
accepted their society gladly and without question.&nbsp; There
was plenty of room on the carpet for such quiet fellows, and if
they liked to accompany me on my travels I, at least, would not
prevent them.</p>
<p>It did not occur to me at the time, as <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>it certainly
does now, that I should never again be so near to fairyland as I
was then.&nbsp; I was inclined to be sceptical concerning the
actual existence of the supernatural, though I recognised that a
judicious acceptance of its theories set a new kingdom beneath
one&rsquo;s feet for play.&nbsp; And it is only now that I
realise how wonderfully vivid my dreams were, with what zest of
timid life the little shadow-folk thrilled and trembled round
me.&nbsp; It is true that I remained conscious of my normal
environment; the fire, the dark room, and the bookcases were all
there, and even a kind of quiet sense of the World beyond the
Door, the hall and the passages and my brothers and sisters at
their quarrels.&nbsp; But it was as if these things had become
merely an idea in my mind, while my feet were set on the pleasant
roads of a new world.&nbsp; The thing that I had hoped became
true; and the truth that I had been taught lingered in my mind
only as a familiar story, a business of second-hand emotions,
neither very desirable nor very interesting.&nbsp; The little
folk gathered and whispered round me in <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>the dark, and
there was full day in the world that was my own.</p>
<p>It was hard to leave that world for this other place, which
even now I cannot understand; but when some errant Olympian or
righteously indignant brother had dragged me from my lair, I did
not attempt to defend myself from the charge of moodiness.&nbsp;
I had no words to tell them what they had done, and I could only
stand blinking beneath the light of the gas in the hall, and
endeavour to recall their wholly tiresome rules and regulations
for the life of youth.&nbsp; Dimly I knew that my right place was
before the fire in the library, and I wondered whether the little
folk could use the Magic Carpet without me, or whether they
stayed expectant in the shadows, like me, a little lonely, and a
little chill.&nbsp; But in those days moodiness was only a lesser
crime than sulkiness, and I had perforce to fold up my fancies
and pass, an emotional bankrupt, into the unsympathetic world of
the playroom.&nbsp; To-morrow, perhaps, the Magic Carpet might be
mine again; meanwhile, I would exist.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Peter
Pan has asked us a good many times whether we believe in
fairies.&nbsp; It is, of course, a matter of faith, to be
accepted or denied, but not to be discussed.&nbsp; For my part, I
think of a little boy nodding on a rug before the fire on many a
winter&rsquo;s evening, and I clap my hands.&nbsp; Gratitude
could do no less.</p>
<h2><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>STAGE
CHILDREN</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">do</span> not know that at any time
Hastings is a very lively place.&nbsp; The houses have acquired a
habit of being vacant, and even the front, with its bath-chairs,
its bandstands that are silent on Sundays, and its seats upon
which one may not smoke, is more suggestive of Puritans and
invalids than of pleasure.&nbsp; If Time should suddenly drop a
week from the due order of days, it is easy to imagine that those
bath-chairs, those unfragrant shelters, those much-labelled
houses would startle the dreaming tourists with vacant faces of
dead men.&nbsp; But when in late March the day has squandered its
gold, and the earth is saddened with the gentle greyness of the
dusk, when, moreover, the cheerful sea has deserted the shore,
creeping far out to leave dull acres of untrodden sand, waste and
bitter with salt, a <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>man might surely be forgiven if he cried aloud against
the extreme cruelty of Nature, the timid injustice of man.</p>
<p>Being of Anglo-Saxon blood, I did not give definite expression
to the melancholy which the quenched seascape had invoked.&nbsp;
I contented myself with leaning on the rail, and sneering at the
art of the cripple who had made mathematically exact scratchings
of Windsor Castle and the Eddystone Lighthouse on the sand.&nbsp;
There was something almost humorously impertinent about that
twisted figure with one foot bowing and hopping for pennies in
front of a terrible back-cloth of dreamy grey.&nbsp; How could a
man forget the horrors of infinite space, and scratch nothings on
the blank face of the earth for coppers?&nbsp; His one foot was
bare so that his Silver-like activities might not spoil his
pictures, and when he was not hopping he shivered
miserably.&nbsp; As I saw him at the moment he stood very well
for humanity&mdash;sordid, grotesque, greedy of mean things,
twisted and bruised by the pitiless hand of Nature.</p>
<p>And then in a flash there happened one of <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>those
miracles which rebuke us when we lack faith.&nbsp; Through the
shadows which were not grey but purple there burst a swarm of
children running on light feet across the sands.&nbsp; They
chased each other hither and thither, stooped to gather shells
and seaweed, and inspected the works of the cripple with
outspoken admiration.&nbsp; Regarding my mournful and terrible
world in detail, they found it beautiful with pink shells and
tangled seaweed and the gallant efforts of men.&nbsp; So far from
being terrified or humiliated by the sombre wastes of sand and
sky, they made of the one a playing-ground, and woke the other
with echoes of their shrill laughter.&nbsp; Perhaps they found
that the sea was rather larger than the Serpentine, perhaps they
thought that the sands were not so well lit as Kingsway; but,
after all, they were making holiday, and at such a time things
are different.&nbsp; They laughed at space.</p>
<p>For these were London children, and all the resources of
civilisation had not been able to deprive them of that sense of
proportion which we lose with age.&nbsp; The stars are <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>small and of
little importance, and even the sun is not much larger than a
brandy-ball.&nbsp; But a golden pebble by the seashore is a
treasure that a child may hold in its hand, and it is certain
that never a grown-up one of us can own anything so surely.&nbsp;
We may search our memories for sunsets and tresses of dead girls,
but who would not give all their faded fragrance for one pink
shell and the power to appreciate it?&nbsp; So it was that I had
found the world wide and ugly and terrible, lacking the
Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp of imagination, which had shown the children
that it was a place of treasure, with darkness to make the search
exciting.&nbsp; They flitted about the beach like eager
moths.</p>
<p>Yet on these children Civilisation had worked with her utmost
cunning, with her most recent resource.&nbsp; For they were
little actors and actresses from Drury Lane, touring in a
pantomime of their own; wise enough in the world&rsquo;s ways to
play grown-up characters with uncommon skill, and bred in the
unreality of the footlights and the falsehood of
grease-paints.&nbsp; Nevertheless, coming fresh from the
elaborate make-belief <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>of the theatre and the intoxicating
applause, they ran down to the sea to find the diamonds and
pearls that alone are real.&nbsp; If this is not wisdom I know
not where wisdom lies, and, watching them, I could have laughed
aloud at the thought of the critics who have told me that the
life of the stage makes children unnatural.&nbsp; There are many
wise and just people who do not like to see children acting,
forgetting perhaps that mimicry is the keynote of all
child&rsquo;s play, and that nothing but this instinct leads
babies to walk upright and to speak with their tongues.&nbsp;
Whether they are on the stage or not, children are always
borrowing the words and emotions of other people, and it is a
part of the charm of childhood that through this mask of tricks
and phrases the real child peeps always into the eyes and hearts
of the elect.</p>
<p>And this is why I know nothing more delightful than the
spectacle of a score of children playing at life on the
stage.&nbsp; They may have been taught how to speak and how to
stand, and what to do with their hands; they may know how to take
a <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>prompt,
and realise the importance of dressing the stage; every trick and
mannerism of the grown-up actor or actress may be theirs; yet,
through their playing there will sound the voice of childhood,
imaginative, adventurous, insistent, and every performance will
supply them with materials for a new game.&nbsp; So it was with
these children, whose sudden coming had strewn the melancholy
beach with pearls.&nbsp; I had seen them in the dimness of a
ballet-room under Drury Lane Theatre; now, with a coin, I bought
the right to see them on a stage built with cynical impertinence
in the midst of the intolerant sea.&nbsp; The play, indeed, was
the same, and the players, but the game was different.&nbsp; The
little breaks and falterings which the author had not designed,
the only half-suppressed laughings which were not in the
prompt-copy, bore no relationship, one might suppose, to the
moral adventures of Mother Goose.&nbsp; But far across the hills
the spring was breaking the buds on the lilac, and far along the
shore the sea was casting its jewels, and even there in the
theatre I could see the children standing on tiptoe to <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>pick lilac,
and stooping on the sands to gather pearls.&nbsp; They did not
see that they were in a place of lank ropes and unsmoothed boards
soiled with the dust of forgotten pageants and rendered hideous
by the glare of electric lights; and they were right.&nbsp; For
in their eyes there shone only that place of adventure which
delights the feet of the faithful, whether they tread the sands,
or the stage, or the rough cobbles of Drury Lane.&nbsp; To the
truly imaginative a theatre is a place of uncommon possibilities;
our actors and actresses, and even our limelight-men, are not
imaginative, and so, I suppose, they find it ugly.&nbsp; The game
is with the children.</p>
<p>And truly they play it for what it is worth, and they are wise
enough to know that it is worth all things, alike on the boards
of the theatre and on the wider, but hardly less artificial,
stage of civilised life.&nbsp; We who are older tremble between
our desire for applause and our unconquerable dread of the angers
of the critical gods and the gaping pit, and it is for this
reason that every bitter-wise adult knows himself to be little <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>better than a
super, a unit of a half-intelligent chorus, who may hope at best
to echo with partial accuracy the songs and careless laughters of
the divine players.&nbsp; There is something pathetic in the
business; for we, too, were once stars, and thought, finely
enough, to hold the heavens for ever with our dreams.&nbsp; But
now we are glad if the limelight shines by accident for a moment
on our faces, or if the stage-manager gives us but one individual
line.&nbsp; We feel, for all the sad fragrance of our old
programmes and newspaper-cuttings, that it is a privilege to play
a part in the pageant at all.&nbsp; The game is with the
children; but if we are wise, there is still somewhere at the
back of the stage a place where each one of us can breathe the
atmosphere of enchantment and dream the old dreams.&nbsp; No
Arcadia is ever wholly lost.</p>
<h2><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>OXFORD
AND CAMBRIDGE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I hear grown-up people
discussing the University Boat Race I smile sadly and hold my
peace.&nbsp; They may say what they like about the latest Oxford
trial, or the average weight per man of the Cambridge crew, but
deep in my heart there stays the conviction that they are making
a ludicrous mistake in speaking about the Boat Race at all.&nbsp;
Once I knew all about it, and even now I think I could put them
right if I wished.&nbsp; But what is the use of arguing with
persons who, under the absurd pretext of fairness, pretend to
find praiseworthy features in both crews?&nbsp; Even the smallest
boy knew better than that in the days when the Boat Race was
really important.&nbsp; I will not say that there did not exist
weaklings even then, who wobbled between Oxford and Cambridge in
an endeavour to propitiate <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>both factions.&nbsp; But they usually
suffered the fate of wobblers by having to join one side or the
other, while still incurring the scorn of both.</p>
<p>The Boat Race dawned upon us each year as a strange and
bewildering element in our social relationships.&nbsp; We would
part one night on normal terms, and the morrow would find us
wearing strange favours, and regarding our friends of yesterday
with open and passionate dislike.&nbsp; For the sake of a morsel
of coloured ribbon old friendships would be shattered and brother
would meet brother with ingenious expressions of contempt.&nbsp;
There was no moderate course in the matter.&nbsp; A boy was
either vehemently Cambridge or intolerably Oxford, and it would
have been easier to account for the colour of his hair than to
explain how he arrived at his choice of a university.&nbsp; Some
blind instinct, some subtle influence felt, perhaps, in the dim,
far-off nursery days may have determined this weighty choice; but
the whole problem was touched with the mystery that inspired the
great classical and modern snowball fights, when little boys
would pound <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>each other almost into a state of unconsciousness for
the sake of a theory of education.&nbsp; Our interest in the Boat
Race as a boat race was small, and quite untroubled by any
knowledge of the respective merits of the crews.&nbsp; But we
wore their colours in our buttonholes, and the effect of these
badges on our lives was anarchic.&nbsp; We saw blue.</p>
<p>It was my fate to drift, fatally and immutably Cambridge, into
a school that had a crushing Oxford majority.&nbsp; In these
circumstances, the light-blue ribbon became, for the small and
devoted band that upheld the Cambridge tradition of valour, the
cause of endless but never conclusive defeats, the symbol of a
splendid martyrdom.&nbsp; Try as we might, we found ourselves
always in a minority, and, to add to our bitterness, these years
of luckless warfare coincided with a series of Cambridge defeats,
and we knew ourselves the supporters of a forlorn and discredited
cause.&nbsp; And yet, Fate having decreed that we should be
Cambridge, we did not falter before our hopeless task of
convincing the majority that it was made of baser stuff than
we.&nbsp; We would arrive <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>in the morning with our colours
stitched to our coats, and when, overwhelmed by numbers, we lost
our dear favours we would retire to a place apart, repair the
loss from a secret store of ribbon, and dash once more into the
fray.&nbsp; The others might be Oxford when they had a mind to,
but we were Cambridge&mdash;Cambridge all the time.</p>
<p>Our contests were always fierce, but only once so far as I
remember did they become really venomous.&nbsp; Some ingenious
Cambridge mind had hit on the idea of protecting his badge with a
secret battery of pins, and there ensued a series of real and
desperate fights that threatened our clan with physical
extinction.&nbsp; The trouble passed as suddenly as it had
arisen; a mysterious rumour went round the clans that pins were
bad form; and there was a lull while Cambridge treated their
black eyes and Oxford put sticking-plaster on their torn
fingers.&nbsp; Pleasanter to remember is the famous retort of
L&mdash;, an utterance so finely dramatic that even to-day I
cannot recall it without a thrill.&nbsp; Caught apart from his
comrades, he was surrounded by the Oxford rabble, and <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>robbed of his
colours.&nbsp; &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t Cambridge now,&rdquo; said
one of his assailants, mockingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, but the sky is
Cambridge!&rdquo; he replied, and indeed it was.&nbsp; We had our
little victories to dull the edge of our defeats.</p>
<p>And yet, probably, we of Cambridge were not altogether sorry
when the Boat Race was over, and the business might be forgotten
for another eleven months, for we had but little rest while the
war of the ribbons was in the air.&nbsp; If we sought to take a
quiet walk round the quad, the chance was that a boy, too small
perhaps to keep a favour even for a minute, but with a light-blue
heart, would run up with tidings of some comrade hardly beset in
the cloisters, and the battle must be begun again.&nbsp; These
contests were sometimes the cause of temporary friendships, for
in the course of the tumult one would find oneself indebted to a
year-long enemy for the timely discomfiture of one&rsquo;s
opponent, who in his turn might be, normally, one&rsquo;s bosom
companion.&nbsp; For no tie was sacred enough to overcome this
vernal madness of the Blues.&nbsp; If a fellow was base enough to
be Oxford, his presence <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>in the world was unnecessary, his
society tabooed.&nbsp; And, as I have said, even brothers would
bang each other&rsquo;s heads for the beauty of the Idea.</p>
<p>Then came a day when age and responsibility changed our views
on a good many things, and the Boat Race was not spared.&nbsp;
Forgetful of the old triumphs and the old despairs, we preferred
to treat ourselves and life in more sober terms, while smiling
tolerantly at the little boys playing their rough games beneath
our feet.&nbsp; Leaning forward with hands eager to clutch our
manhood, we would not for worlds have compromised our new
position by taking an interest in such childish trifles as
coloured ribbons.&nbsp; So the game went on without us, and the
measure of our loss is the measure of the loss of the earth when
the spring melts into summer.</p>
<p>To-day I hear persons discussing the Boat Race in
railway-carriages, and in face of their dispassionate judgments I
ask myself whether they can ever have sung for it and fought for
it, and, let it be added, wept for it, as I have done.&nbsp; In
truth, I suppose they <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>have; for boys do not differ widely
in these essential things.&nbsp; But these people do not fight;
they do not even wear the ribbon!&nbsp; While it is open to a man
to ignore the Boat Race altogether, I cannot understand his
approaching the contest in so miserable a spirit.</p>
<h2><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>HAROLD</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">suppose</span> that every one has made
the acquaintance of the subject of this little biography at some
time or other, though to others he may not have appeared as he
has appeared to me, and, as I know, he has been called by many
names.&nbsp; Indeed, when I consider that there have been men and
women who have sought his society with a passionate eagerness, it
is clear to me that his disguises must be extremely subtle, and
that he employs them with a just regard for the personalities of
his companions.&nbsp; For while some have found in his society
the ultimate splendour of life, for me he has always been
wearisome and ridiculously mean.</p>
<p>Of course it may be that I have known him too long, for even
as a child I was accustomed to find him at my side, an unwelcome
guest who came and went by no law that <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>my youthful
mind could determine.&nbsp; Certainly in those days he was more
capricious, and the method of argument by repetition, which he
still employs, was only too well calculated to weary and distress
a child.&nbsp; But for the rest, the Harold whom I knew then was
materially the Harold whom I know now.&nbsp; Conceive a small man
so severely afflicted with St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance that his
features are hardly definable, endow him with a fondness for
clothes of dull colours grievously decorated with spots, and a
habit of asking meaningless questions over and over again in an
utterly unemotional voice, and you will be able to form a not
unfair estimate of the joys of Harold&rsquo;s society.&nbsp;
There have been exceptions, however, to the detestable
colourlessness of Harold&rsquo;s appearance.&nbsp; I have seen
him on occasion dressed in flaming red, like Mephistopheles, and
his shrill staccato voice has pierced my head like a
corkscrew.&nbsp; But these manifestations have always been brief,
and might even be considered enjoyable when compared with the
unrestful monotony of Harold&rsquo;s society in general.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Who
taught me to call him by the name of Harold I do not know, but in
my youthful days the man&rsquo;s character was oddly associated
with the idea of virtue as expounded in the books I read on
Sunday afternoons.&nbsp; That I hated him was, I felt, merely a
fitting attribute in one whose instincts were admittedly bad, but
I did not allow the consideration to affect my rejoicings when I
escaped from his company.&nbsp; Curiously, too, I perceived that
the Olympians were with me in this, and since the moral soundness
of those improving books was beyond question, I had grave doubts
as to their ultimate welfare.&nbsp; But it was always an easy
task to detect the Olympians tripping in their own moralities;
they had so many.</p>
<p>As time went on, and I grew out of the Sunday books and all
that they stood for, I came to believe that I was growing out of
Harold too.&nbsp; His appearances became rare, and, from his
point of view, a little ineffective.&nbsp; It pleased me to
consider with a schoolboy&rsquo;s arrogance that he was little
more than a child&rsquo;s nightmare, and that if <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>a man
turned to fight him Harold would vanish.&nbsp; For a while
Harold, in his cunning, played up to this idea.&nbsp; He would
seek my side timidly, and fly at a word.&nbsp; The long,
sleepless nights of childhood and the weary days were forgotten,
and I made of him a jest.&nbsp; Sometimes I wondered whether he
really existed.</p>
<p>And then he came.&nbsp; At first I was only mildly astonished
when I found that nothing I could say would make him leave me,
but as the hours passed the old hatred asserted itself, and to
fight the little man with the dull voice and the cruel spots on
his clothes seemed all that there was in life to do.&nbsp; The
hours passed into days and nights, and sometimes I was passive in
the hope that he might weary, sometimes I shouted answers to his
questions&mdash;the same answer to the same question&mdash;over
and over again.&nbsp; I felt, too, that if I could only see his
features plainly for a moment he would disappear, and I would
stare at him until the sky grew red as my eyes.&nbsp; But I could
not see him clearly, and the world became a thing of dull
colours, terrible with spots.&nbsp; <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>By now I was fighting him with a
sense of my own fatuity, for I felt that nothing would make this
man fight fairly.&nbsp; His voice had fallen to a passionless
whisper and the spots on his clothes swelled into obscene
blotches and burst like over-ripe fruit.&nbsp; It was then that
the chloroform clutched me by the throat.&nbsp; I have never
known anything on earth more sweet.</p>
<p>Since then, it seems to me, Harold has never been quite the
same.&nbsp; He comes to see me now and again, and sometimes even
he lingers by my side.&nbsp; But there is a note of doubt about
him that I do not remember to have noticed before&mdash;some of
his former spirit would seem to be lacking, and I am forced to
wonder sometimes whether Harold is not ageing.&nbsp; And, though
it may appear strange, the thought inspires me with a certain
regret.&nbsp; I do not like the man, and I should be mad to seek
him of my own accord, but in fairness I must acknowledge that in
a negative way he has contributed to all the pleasures I have
enjoyed.&nbsp; Sunsets and roses and the white light of the
stars&mdash;I owe my appreciation of them all to Harold; <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>and I know
that it is by aid of his keen realism that I have founded the
city of my dreams.&nbsp; It will be a grey world when Harold is
no more.</p>
<h2><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>ON
DIGGING HOLES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> all the world was young and we
were young with it there was no occupation more pleasing to our
infant minds than the digging of great holes in that placid and
maternal earth that endured the trampling of our childish feet
with patience, and betrayed no realisation of the extraordinary
miracle of life that had set us dancing in the fields and valleys
of the world.&nbsp; As repentant children trace with curious
finger on their mother&rsquo;s foreheads the lines that they
themselves have set there, so we followed the furrows on the
forehead of our mother Earth with our little spades, smoothing
here and deepening there, and not the less contented that our
labours had but a vague and illusory aim.&nbsp; Sometimes,
perhaps, we had a half-formed ambition to dig to those dim and
incredible Antipodes where children walk <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>head
downwards, clinging to the earth with their feet, like the flies
on the playroom&rsquo; ceiling.&nbsp; Sometimes, perhaps, we dug
for treasure, immense masses of golden coin, like those memorable
hoards described in &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Gold Bug.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, again, it might be that we
planned vast caves and galleries wherein tawny pirates and swart
smugglers might carouse, shocking the echoes with blood-curdling
oaths, and drinking boiling rum like Quilp.&nbsp; We dug, in
fine.</p>
<p>There seems to be some element in the human mind that is
definitely attracted by the digging of holes, for it is not only
children who are interested by the spectacle.&nbsp; The genial
excavators whose duty it is to make havoc of the London streets
never fail to draw an attentive and apparently appreciative
audience, whether of loafers or philosophers the critic may not
lightly determine.&nbsp; They gaze into the pit with countenances
of abysmal profundity, that appear to see all, to understand all,
and to express nothing in particular.&nbsp; It is possible that
they are placidly enjoying the reflection that beneath <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the complex
contrivances of our civilisation, beneath London itself, the
virgin earth lies unturned and unaffected.&nbsp; Perhaps, as each
spadeful of earth reaches the surface, they perceive, like a
child watching the sawdust trickle from the broken head of a
doll, that here is the raw material of which worlds are
made.&nbsp; Perhaps they do not think at all, but merely derive a
mild satisfaction from watching other people work.&nbsp; Yet it
is at least agreeable to believe that they are watchers for the
unexpected, that they have discovered the great truth that if you
dig long enough you will probably dig something up.</p>
<p>We children knew this very well, and we never dug without
feeling the thrill proper to treasure-seekers.&nbsp; Even half a
brick becomes eventful when found in these circumstances, and the
earth had a hundred pleasant secrets in the shape of fragments of
pottery, mysterious lumps of metal and excited insects for those
who approached her reverently, trowel in hand.&nbsp; It was this
variety of treasure that made us prefer inland digging <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>to those
more fashionable excavations that are carried on at the
seaside.&nbsp; Sand is a friendly substance in which to dig, and
it is very convenient to have a supply of water like the sea
close at hand when it is necessary to fill a pond or add a touch
of realism to a moat.&nbsp; But the ease with which sand obeys
the spade soon becomes monotonous, and the seaside in general
suffers from an air of having been elaborately prepared for
children to play there.&nbsp; Our delving operations in the
garden had the charm of nominal illegality, and the brown earth
had a hundred moods to thwart and help and enchant us
continually.&nbsp; Sometimes we dug with scientific precision;
sometimes we set to work with fury, flinging the earth to all
sides in our eagerness to rob her of her secrets.&nbsp; A
philosopher might have found in us a striking instance of the
revolt of civilised man against Nature; a woman would have
noticed that we were getting our pinafores dirty.</p>
<p>And though we liked digging for its own sake, we were not
unmindful of the possibilities of a good big hole.&nbsp; From its
cool <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>depths we could obtain a new aspect of the sky; and,
cunningly roofed over with branches and earth, it made a snug
retreat for a harassed brigand and a surprising pitfall for the
unwary gardener.&nbsp; In smaller cavities we concealed treasure
of stones decked with the colours left behind by the painters at
the last spring-cleaning, and if we could not wholly convince
ourselves of their intrinsic value, they at least bore adequate
resemblance to the treasures of Aladdin&rsquo;s cave, as revealed
to us in pantomime.&nbsp; We kept the knowledge of the spots
where these treasures were buried a close secret, even from each
other, and it was etiquette for the finder of one of these
repositories to remove its contents and conceal them
elsewhere.&nbsp; The conflict between seeker and finder never
languished, and men who rose up millionaires would go to bed
paupers.</p>
<p>Like all sincere artists, we did not allow our own efforts to
hinder a just appreciation of those of others, and we had the
utmost admiration for rabbits, down whose enchanted burrows we
would peer <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>longingly, reflecting wisely how fine a home it must be
that had so romantic and fascinating an entrance.&nbsp; For us
half the charm of &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; lay in the natural and
sensible means by which she reached her wonderland, though we
could never bring ourselves to forgive the author for pretending
that his clearly veracious narrative was only a dream.&nbsp;
This, we recognised, was an obvious grown-up device for
preventing the youthful from slipping away from governesses to
wonderlands of their own, and true enough we found rabbit-holes
oddly reluctant to admit our small bodies, even though we widened
their mouths with our trowels.&nbsp; Looking-glasses, it may be
mentioned, proved no less refractory, and at this day, it is
said, children find it impossible to emulate the flying feats of
&ldquo;Peter Pan,&rdquo; though they carefully follow the
directions.&nbsp; It is clear that these grown-up authors are not
wholly straightforward with their youthful readers, but guard the
Olympian interests by concealing some essential part of the
ritual in these matters.&nbsp; Sooner or later the children find
them out, and expel them from <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>all nurseries, playrooms, gardens,
and places where youth and wisdom congregate.</p>
<p>But if we could not tread those long corridors into which the
rabbits scuttled so featly on our approach, there was nothing to
hinder us from digging a tunnel to fairyland of our own.&nbsp;
The grand project formed, all the forces of the garden would
unite, and we would dig seriously for an hour or so.&nbsp; At the
end of that time somebody&rsquo;s foot would be hurt by a spade,
or some bright spirit would suggest that we should fill the hole
with water and call it a lake.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, it would be
teatime&mdash;at all events, we never got to fairyland at
all.&nbsp; Or did we?&nbsp; As we grow old our memories fade, but
dimly I seem to remember a garden that was like no garden I have
found in grown-up places.&nbsp; It is possible that we did reach
fairyland, treading the same road that Alice and Cinderella and
Aladdin had trod before us.&nbsp; Perhaps a grown-up writer may
be pardoned for forgetting.</p>
<h2><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>REAL
CRICKET</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> willing to leave to other and
more skilful hands the pleasure of narrating the joys and trials
of county cricket, club cricket, and the splendid cricket of
country houses and village greens.&nbsp; Not that my task is the
more modest, for, having a just regard for relative values, I
think that it is of cricket I write, such cricket as small boys
play in dreams (ah, me, those sixes that small boys hit in
dreams!); such cricket as the ghosts enjoy at nights at
Lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is well for the eye to take pleasure in
shining flannels and ivory-white boots; there is a thrill in the
science of the game, the swerve of the new red ball, the quick
play of the batsmen&rsquo;s feet; but I think that when good
cricketers die it is not to such elaborate sport as this that
they betake themselves in the happy playing-fields.&nbsp; To mow
the astonished <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>daisies in quick retort to the hardly gentlemanly
sneak; to pull like Mr. Jessop because one knows no better; to be
bowled by every straight yorker; to slog at full pitches with
close-shut eyes; thus and thus only is the cricket of
Arcadia.</p>
<p>In its simplest form we played it in the garden after dinner,
but even here environment and our imaginations combined to make
it complicated.&nbsp; The lawn was small, and there were
flower-beds and windows to be considered.&nbsp; The former did
not trouble us very much; indeed, we lopped the French lilies
with a certain glee, but a broken window was a more serious
business, and lofty drives to the off were therefore
discouraged.&nbsp; Yet once, I recollect, the ball was sent
through the same window three times in an afternoon.&nbsp; Of
course, the unfortunate batsman who allowed his enthusiasm thus
to outdrive his discretion was out, as also was he who hit the
ball into the next garden.&nbsp; But this latter rule was rather
conventional than imposed by necessity, for we were fortunate in
the possession of a charming neighbour; and sometimes youth, <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>adventuring
in search of cricket-balls, would be regaled with seed-cake and
still lemonade, and return rampant to his comrades.&nbsp; But the
great zest of our games lay in our impersonation of real famous
cricketers.&nbsp; We would take two county sides, and divide the
r&ocirc;les of their members amongst us, so that each of us would
represent two or three members of each team.&nbsp; The
score-sheets of these matches would convey a strange impression
to the erudition of the New Zealander.&nbsp; For the greatest
cricketers failed to score frequently, and, indeed, inevitably if
they happened to be left-handed bats.&nbsp; So far our passion
for accuracy carried us, but, like Tom Sawyer, we had to
&ldquo;lay on&rdquo; that we bowled left-handed when it was in
the part, while realistic impersonations of lightning bowlers
were too dangerous to the batsman to be permitted.</p>
<p>These great contests did not pass without minor
disagreements.&nbsp; The rights of age were by no means waived,
and in those days I was firmly convinced that the l.b.w. rule had
been invented by the M.C.C. to assist elder brothers in getting
their rights.&nbsp; Moreover, <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>there was always high argument over
the allocation of the parts of the more popular cricketers.&nbsp;
My sister, I remember, would retire wrathfully from the game if
she were not allowed to be K. J. Key, and so, when Surrey was
playing, we had to permit her to be titular captain.&nbsp; Girls
are very keen at cricket, but they are not good at it.&nbsp; Or
perhaps in the course of the game &ldquo;W. G.&rdquo; would find
it necessary to chase Lockwood all over the field for bowling
impudently well.&nbsp; Yet while we mimicked our elders we
secretly thought Olympian cricket a poor, unimaginative game
without any quarrels.&nbsp; It was thrilling to bat for the
honour of Mr. Fry, or to make a fine catch in the long field for
Mr. Mason&rsquo;s sake, but our personal idiosyncrasies also had
their value.</p>
<p>When we went away for our holidays it was ours to adventure
with bat and ball on unaccustomed grounds: meadow cricket was
tiresome, for the ball would hide itself in the long grass; and
seaside cricket, though exhilarating, was too public a business
to be taken really seriously.&nbsp; But cricket in the pinewoods
was delightful&mdash;almost, I <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>think, the best cricket of
all.&nbsp; The soft needles made an admirable pitch, and we had
all the trees for fielders.&nbsp; If you hit the ball against a
tree full-pitch, you were out, and it was strange how those
patient, silent fieldsmen, who never dropped catches, seemed to
arrange themselves, as the game progressed, in the conventional
places in the field.&nbsp; Point would be there, and mid-off, and
some safe men in the slips.&nbsp; Overhead the birds would call
in the trees, and there were queer echoes when you hit the ball
hard, as though Pan were watching from some dim pavilion and
crying his applause.&nbsp; Really I wonder how we dared, or
perhaps it were fitter to wonder why we dare no longer.</p>
<p>The oddest cricket I ever played was with a gardener, a
reticent, impassive man, who came and played with me when sudden
mumps had exiled me from my holiday-making comrades.&nbsp; He
would bowl to me silently for hours, only parting his lips now
and again to murmur the name of the stump which he proposed to
hit with his next ball, and no efforts of mine could prevent his
grim prophecies from being fulfilled.&nbsp; When I gave <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>him his
innings he would pat my widest and most wily balls back to me
politely until he thought I was tired, and then he would let me
bowl him.&nbsp; This unequal contest was not cricket as I knew
it, but it fascinated me nevertheless.&nbsp; At night in my bed I
would hit his bowling all over the world and upset his stumps
with monotonous ease.&nbsp; By day I could only serve his
humour.&nbsp; The devil was in the man.</p>
<p>The bats with which we played were normal save in size, but
the balls varied.&nbsp; In times of prosperity we had real
leather cricket-balls, but the balls known as
&ldquo;compos&rdquo; were more common.&nbsp; When new they had a
noble appearance, but use made them rough and like dry earth in
the hand, and then they were apt to sting the fingers of the
unwary cricketer.&nbsp; The most perilous kind of ball of all was
the size of a cricket-ball, but made of solid rubber, and deadly
alike to batsman and fieldsman.&nbsp; For some reason or other
the proper place in which to carry a cricket-ball was the
trousers, or rather knickerbockers, pocket.&nbsp; The curious
discomfort of this practice lingers in the <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>mind.&nbsp;
Soft balls are of no use in real cricket; but if you bore a hole
in them and fill them with water they make very good bombs for
practical anarchists.</p>
<p>Later came school cricket, but it is significant that the
impression that lingers is of the long drives home in the dusk
from out-matches rather than of the cricket itself.&nbsp; We
would walk up the hills to rest the horses, playing
&ldquo;touch&rdquo; and imprisoning unfortunate glow-worms in
wooden matchboxes.&nbsp; And later still came visits to
Lord&rsquo;s and the Oval, when it was my fortune to see some of
our old heroes in the flesh.&nbsp; Certainly they made more runs
than they had been wont to do in the past, but&mdash;&nbsp; It is
not wise to examine our heroes too closely, though I am not alone
in thinking that first-class cricketers are lacking a little in
the old spirit.&nbsp; Indeed, how can they hope to keep it, they
who are grown so wise?</p>
<h2><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>THE
BOY IN THE GARDEN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were two kinds of gardening
to employ our sunny hours&mdash;the one concerned with the vast
tracts of the Olympians, the other with the cultivation of those
intimate patches of earth known as &ldquo;the children&rsquo;s
gardens,&rdquo; wherein was waged an endless contest between
Nature and our views of what a garden should be.&nbsp; Of the
joys of this nobler order of tillage I have written elsewhere,
and I may not penetrate now into that mysterious world beyond the
shrubbery, where plants assumed the proportions of mammoth trees,
and beds of mustard-and-cress took the imaginative eye of youth
as boundless prairies.&nbsp; But if the conventional aims of
grown-up gardening set limits to our fancy, if their ideal of
beauty in the garden&mdash;unfriendly as it was to cricket and
the fiercer outbreaks of Indians&mdash;was none <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>of ours, we
found, nevertheless, certain details in the process by which they
sought to attain their illusory ends stimulating and wholly
delightful.&nbsp; Flowers might inspire in us no more than a rare
and short-lived curiosity, but the watering-pot (and even better
the garden-hose) were our very good friends.&nbsp; Tidiness was
no merit in the garden of our dreams, but our song of joy rose
straight to heaven with the smoke of bonfires.&nbsp; Meadows were
more to our taste than the prim culture of lawns, but in our
hands the lawn-mower became a flaming chariot, and we who drove
it as unscorched Phaetons praised for the zest with which we
pursued our pleasure by all Olympus.</p>
<p>It was one of the charms of childhood that such praise would
sometimes fall from the lips of our rulers as suddenly and as
mysteriously as their censure.&nbsp; It was pleasant, after a
gorgeous afternoon spent in extinguishing imaginary
conflagrations with the garden hose to be congratulated on the
industry with which we had watered the flowers.&nbsp; It was
pleasant to be rewarded with chocolates from France for burning
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>witches
on the rubbish-heap behind the greenhouse.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact, we never &ldquo;helped&rdquo; the gardener unless it suited
us, and we would have hidden in the shrubbery a whole day rather
than be entrapped into half an hour&rsquo;s weeding&mdash;an
occupation which we regarded in the light of a severe
punishment.&nbsp; And the odd confusion in the grown-up mind
between right and wrong never ceased to intrigue us.&nbsp; When
my elder brother, in a sentimental hour, flung a wreath of roses
on to the stately head of the aunt of the moment, we knew that it
was a pretty thought, very happily translated into action; but
the Olympians treated it as a crime.&nbsp; Yet it was not his
fault that the thorns tore her hair; had there been any thornless
roses he would probably have used them.&nbsp; And, being honest,
we wondered no less when we were praised for playing with the
garden-hose, that coiled about our legs like wet snakes, and made
our stockings wet on the warmest summer day; for in our hearts we
knew that into any occupation so pleasant must surely enter the
elements of crime.&nbsp; But the rulers of our destiny <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>would bid
us change our wet clothes with a calm brow, and would
congratulate each other on our interest in the garden.&nbsp; We
lived in a strange world.</p>
<p>The judgments of the gardener we could better understand,
though, alas! we had to sum him up as unreliable.&nbsp; He was a
twisted little man who had been to sea in his youth, and we knew
that he had been a pirate because he had a red face, an enormous
clasp-knife, and knew how to make every imaginable kind of
knot.&nbsp; Moreover, there was a small barrel in the tool-house
that had manifestly held gunpowder once upon a time.&nbsp; Such
evidence as this was not to be refuted, but we had to conclude
that he had been driven from the High Seas in disgrace, for he
was pitifully lacking in the right pirate spirit.&nbsp; No
pirate, we felt, would have taken the tale of our petty misdeeds
to the Olympian courts for settlement, yet this is what Esau did
under cover of a duplicity that aggravated the offence.&nbsp; In
one and the same hour he would expound to us the intricacies of
the Chinese knot with many friendly and sensible observations, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>and tell
the shocked Olympians that we had thrown his rose-sticks all over
the garden in the manner of javelins.&nbsp; Captain Shark, of the
barque <i>Rapacious</i>, would not have acted like this, if it
was conceivable that that sinister hero could have turned
gardener.&nbsp; Perhaps he would have smitten us sorely with the
Dutch hoe, or scalped us with his pruning-knife by means of a
neat twist learnt in Western America, but whatever form his
revenge might have assumed he would have scorned to betray us to
the people who had forgotten how to play.&nbsp; Esau was a sad
knave.</p>
<p>And, unlike the Olympians, he had no illusions as to the value
of our labours in the garden, treating our generous assistance
with the scantiest gratitude, and crediting our enthusiasm with
the greater part of Nature&rsquo;s shortcomings.&nbsp; Whenever
our horticultural efforts became at all spirited he would start
up suddenly from behind a hedge and admonish us as the boy in
&ldquo;Prunella&rdquo; admonishes the birds.&nbsp; He would not
allow us to irrigate the flower-beds by means of a system of
canals; he checked, or at least <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>attempted to check, our consumption
of fruit, deliciously unripe (has any one noticed that an unripe
greengage eaten fresh from the tree is a gladder thing than any
ripe fruit?); he would not let us play at executions with the
scythe, or at avalanches with the garden-roller.&nbsp; The
man&rsquo;s soul was a cabbage, and I fear that he regarded us as
a tiresome kind of vermin that he might not destroy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as the Olympians liked to see us employed in the
garden, he could not wholly refuse our proffered aid, and he
would watch our adventures with the garden-hose and the
lawn-mower, with his piratical features incarnadined, as it were,
by the light of his lurid past.&nbsp; Naturally, water being a
good friend of children, to water the garden was the most popular
task of all, and as I was the youngest brother it was but rarely
that I was privileged to experience that rare delight.&nbsp; To
feel the cool rush of the water through fingers hot with play and
the comfortable trickle down one&rsquo;s sleeve, to smite a plant
with muddy destruction and to hear the cheerful sound made <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>by the
torrent in falling on to the soaked lawn&mdash;these and their
fellow-emotions may not be those of adult gardeners, but they are
not to be despised.&nbsp; But as I have said, they were not for
me, and usually I had to be content with mowing the lawn, an
occupation from which I drew a full measure of placid
enjoyment.</p>
<p>Age dims our realisation of the emotional significance of our
own actions, and it is only by an effort of memory that I can
arrive at the philosophy of the contented mower of lawns.&nbsp; I
suppose that professional gardeners find the labour monotonous,
lacking both the artistic interest of such work as pruning and
the scientific subtleties of cucumber-growing; but youth has the
precious faculty of finding the extraordinary in the commonplace,
and I had only to drag the lawn-mower from its rugged bed among
the forks and spades in the tool-house, to embark on a sea of
intricate and diverse adventure.</p>
<p>The very appearance of the thing was cheery and companionable,
with its hands outstretched to welcome mine, and its coat <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>of green
more vivid than any lawn.&nbsp; To seize hold of its smooth
handles was like shaking hands with an old friend, and as it
rattled over the gravel path it chattered to me in the gruff
tones of a genial uncle.&nbsp; Once on the smooth lawn its voice
thrilled to song, tremulous and appealing, and filled with the
throbbing of great wings.&nbsp; Even now I know no sound that
cries of the summer so poignantly as the intermittent song of the
lawn-mower heard far off through sunny gardens.&nbsp; And cheered
by that song I might drive my chariot, or it might be my plough,
where I would.&nbsp; Not for me the stiff brocaded pattern
beloved of Esau; I made curves, skirting the shadows of the tall
poplars or cutting the lawn into islands and lagoons.&nbsp; Over
the grass-box&mdash;or the nose-bag, as we called it&mdash;the
grass danced like a mist of green flies, and I beheaded the
daisies with the zest of a Caligula, pausing sometimes to marvel
at those modest blossoms that survived my passage.&nbsp; I
marvelled, too, with the cold inhumanity of youth, at the
injudicious earthworms that tried to stay my progress, and
perished for <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>their pains.&nbsp; Sometimes a stray pebble would grate
unpleasantly on the blades and waken my lulled senses with a
jerk; sometimes I would drive too close to a flower-bed, and
munched fragments of pansies and wallflowers would glow amongst
the grass in the grass-box.</p>
<p>No doubt a part of my enjoyment lay in the feeding of that
natural spirit of destructiveness that present-day Olympians
satisfy with frequent gifts of clockwork toys, ingenious
mechanisms very proper to be inquired into by young
fingers.&nbsp; But there was more in it than that.&nbsp; I liked
the smell of the newly cut grass, and I would run my fingers
through it and press damp, warm handfuls of it to my face to win
the full savour of it.&nbsp; I even liked the more pungent odour
of the grass-heap where last week&rsquo;s grass lay drying in the
sun.&nbsp; And the effort necessary to drive the worker of
wonders across the lawn gave me a pleasant sense of my own
sturdiness.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that, with all these reasons, I cannot
wholly fathom the true philosophy of lawn-mowing with my adult <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>mind.&nbsp;
I have set down all the joys that I remember, but some
significant fact, some essential note of enchantment, is
missing.&nbsp; What did I think about as I pressed to and fro
with my lawn-mower?&nbsp; Sometimes, perhaps, I was a ploughman,
guiding vast horses along the crests of mountains, and pausing
now and again to examine the treasures that my labour had
revealed in the earth, leather bags of guineas and jewelled
crowns that sparkled through their mask of clay.&nbsp; Sometimes
I might be a charioteer driving a team of mad horses round the
circus for Nero&rsquo;s pleasure, or a fireman driving a
fire-engine scatheless through bewildered streets.&nbsp; But with
all I believe that sometimes I was no more than a little boy,
mowing the lawn of a sunny garden, loving the task for its own
sake, and inspired by no subtler spirit than that which led Esau
to cultivate cabbages with dogged enthusiasm.&nbsp; It would not
do to condemn that dishonoured pirate because he saw heaven as a
kitchen-garden and regarded flowers as the fond toys of the
Olympian dotage.&nbsp; He, too, had his illusions; he, too, while
he sowed the seed had <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>visions of an impossible
harvest.&nbsp; His ultimate fate eludes my memory, but doubtless
he has finished with his husbandry by now.&nbsp; I, too, no
longer mow the lawn save when arrayed in fantastic knickerbockers
and dream-shod as of yore I trim the grass-plats of sleep with a
lawn-mower that sings as birds no longer sing.&nbsp; What the
purpose of my youthful labours may have been I do not know. . .

130</span>CHILDREN AND THE SEA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sea, like all very large
things, can only be intimately understood by children.&nbsp; If
we can conceive a sensible grown-up person looking at the sea for
the first time, we feel that he should either yawn or wish to
drown himself.&nbsp; But a child would take a sample of it in a
bucket, and consider that in all its aspects; and then it would
know that the sea is a great many bucketfuls of water, and
further that by an odd freak of destiny this water is not fit to
drink.&nbsp; Storms and ships and sand-castles and lighthouses
and all the other side-shows would follow later; but in the
meantime the child would have seen the sea in a bucket, as it had
previously seen the moon in a looking-glass, so would know all
about it.&nbsp; The moon is a variable and interesting kind of
lamp; the sea is buckets and buckets and buckets full <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>of
water.&nbsp; I think the stars are holes in a sort of black
curtain or ceiling, and the sun is a piece of brightness, except
at sunset or in a mist, when it is a whole Dutch cheese.&nbsp;
The world is streets and fields and the seaside and our
house.</p>
<p>I doubt whether a child has any sense of what I may call the
appeal of breadth.&nbsp; If it is confronted with a fine view, it
will concentrate its interest on a windmill or a doll&rsquo;s
house, and the seaside is no more than a place where one wears no
shoes or stockings, and the manufacture of mud pies becomes
suddenly licit.&nbsp; The child does not share the torments of
the adult Londoner, who feels that there is no room in the world
to stretch his arms and legs, and therefore wins a pathetic sense
of freedom in seeing the long yellow sands and the green wastes
of the sea.&nbsp; Nor is it at all excited by the consideration
that there is a lot more sea beyond the horizon; the extent of
its interest in the water is the limit to which it may
paddle.</p>
<p>Yet in some dim, strange way the child realises &aelig;sthetic
values more here than elsewhere.&nbsp; I am quite sure it can see
no real <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>beauty in its normal surroundings.&nbsp; Sunsets and
small houses lit for evening, the shining streets after rain, and
even flowers and pictures and dolls, are never beautiful to a
child in the sense that a story or an idea may be
beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; But tacitly, for a child has no language
to express such things, something of the blueness of the sea
seems to seek expression in its eyes, something of the sparkle of
the sand seems to be tangled in its hair, something of the
sunshine burns in its rounded calves that glow like brown
eggs.&nbsp; A child is always a thing of wonder.&nbsp; But on the
edge of the sea this wonder deepens until the artificial observer
is abashed.&nbsp; A seaside child is no creature to be petted and
laughed over; it were as easy to pet the tireless waters, and to
laugh over the grave of a little cat; children whom one has known
very well indeed in town will find new playing fields by the sea
into which it is impossible to follow them.&nbsp; Dorothy weighs
five stone four pounds at Maida Vale; at Littlehampton the sea
wind blows her along like a feather; she is become a wispy,
spiritual thing, a <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>faint, fair creature a-dance on light feet that would
make the fairy-girl of a poet&rsquo;s dream seem clumsy by
comparison.&nbsp; She is nearer to us when she paddles.&nbsp; The
warm sand creeping up through her toes, the silver thread of
coolness about her legs, these things are within our
comprehension though they fall no more within our
experience.&nbsp; But when she flings herself along the beach
with the wild hair and loose limbs and the song of an innocent
Bacchante, when she bids the gold sands heave up and support her
body, tired with play, when she stoops to gather diamonds and
pearls from the shore made wet and smooth by the retreating
waves, she is as far from us and our human qualities as a
new-awakened butterfly.&nbsp; There have been sea-washed moments
when I should not have been astonished if she had flung out a
pair of mother-of-pearl wings and stood in the blue sky, like a
child saint in a stained-glass window.&nbsp; There have been
other moments when she has approached me with a number of
impossible questions in wanton parody of her simple London
self.&nbsp; Between these two extremes her moods vary <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>from second
to second, and she plays upon them as Pan upon his pipes, and to
much the same tune.&nbsp; She loves the long tresses of seaweed
and the pink shells like the nails of her own little hands; and
her coloured pail, when she is not the architect of sea-girt
palaces, is a treasury of salty wonders.&nbsp; To climb the rough
rocks and call them mountains, to drive back the waves with a
chiding foot, and to alter the face of Nature with a wooden
spade, these were not tasks for the domesticated creature who
shares the hearth-rug with the cat at home.&nbsp; But the spirit
of the sea has changed Dorothy; she is now a little more and a
little less than child; and she recognises no comrades but those
other nymphs of the sea, who hold the beach with the sparkle of
wet feet and careless petticoats, who run hither and thither in
search of the big adventure, while their parents and guardians
sleep in the sun.&nbsp; It is hard that age should deprive us of
so many privileges, and least of all can we spare the glamour of
the sands of the sea.&nbsp; Yet to the adult mind Brighton beach,
sprinkled with newspapers and washed by <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>a sea whose
surface is black with smuts, brings little but disgust.&nbsp; We
insist on having our fairy-lands clean and end, too often, by
finding no fairy-land at all.&nbsp; The sea, after all, is no
more than water that may be caught in a bucket; the sand may
glitter on a child&rsquo;s spade, and we who believe that the
essential knowledge of the thing is ours are no wiser than the
children.&nbsp; For me the sea is a restless and immeasurable
waste of greens and blues and greys, and I know that its strength
lies in its monotony.&nbsp; It is not the noisy turbulence of
storms that moves me to fear, but the dull precision of the tides
and the tireless succession of waves.&nbsp; And my impression is
no truer than the children&rsquo;s and lends itself less readily
to a sympathetic manner of living.&nbsp; I feel that if I could
once more hold the ocean in my bucket, if the whole earth might
be uprooted by my spade, I should be nearer to a sense of the
value of life than I am now.&nbsp; I see the children go trooping
by with their calm eyes, not, as is sometimes said, curious, but
rather tolerant of life, and I know that for them the universe is
merely an aggregate of details, <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>some agreeable and some stupid,
while I must needs depress myself by regarding it as a
whole.&nbsp; And this is the proved distinction between juvenile
and adult philosophies, if we may be permitted to regard a
child&rsquo;s very definite point of view as the effect of a
philosophy.&nbsp; Life is a collection of little bits of
experience; the seaside bits are pleasant, and there is nothing
more to be said.</p>
<h2><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>ON
GOING TO BED</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the winter fires were burning
their merriest in the grates, or when the summer sun was melting
to crimson shadows down in the western fields, we, pressing our
noses on the window-panes in placable discussion of the
day&rsquo;s cricket, or dreaming our quiet dreams on the playroom
floor, would hear a heart-breaking pronouncement fall tonelessly
from the lips of the Olympians: &ldquo;Come, children, it is time
you were in bed!&rdquo;&nbsp; It needed no more than that to
bring our hearts to zero with a run, and set our lips quivering
in eloquent but supremely useless protest.&nbsp; Against this
decree there was, we knew, no appeal; and we pleaded our hopeless
cause rather from habit than from any expectation of
success.&nbsp; And even while we uttered passionate expressions
of our individual wakefulness, and <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>vowed our impatience for the coming
of that golden age when we should be allowed to sit up all night,
we were collecting the honoured toys that shared our beds, in
mournful recognition of the inevitable.</p>
<p>It was not that we had any great objection to bed in itself,
but that fate always decreed that bed-time should fall in the
brightest hour of the day.&nbsp; No matter what internecine
conflicts, whether with the Olympians or each other, had rendered
the day miserable, when bed-time drew near the air was sweet with
the spirit of universal brotherhood, as though in face of our
common danger we wished to propitiate the gods by means of our
unwonted merit.&nbsp; Feuds were patched up, confiscated property
was restored to its rightful owner, and brother hailed brother
with a smiling countenance and that genial kind of rudeness that
passed with us for politeness.&nbsp; This was the time of day,
too, when the more interesting kind of Olympian would make his
appearance, uncles&mdash;at least, we called them
uncles&mdash;who could perform conjuring tricks and tell exciting
stories, and aunts who kissed us, but had a compensating <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>virtue in
that they had been known to produce unexpected sweets.&nbsp; The
house that might have been a gloomy prison of dullness during the
long day became, by a sudden magic, entertaining and happily
alive.&nbsp; The kitchen was fragrant with the interesting odours
that come from the cooking of strange adult viands; the passages
were full of strong men who could lift small boys to the ceiling
without an effort, and who would sometimes fling sixpences about
with prodigal lavishness; the whole place was gay with parcels to
be opened, and lively, if incomprehensible, conversation.&nbsp;
And ever while we were thrilling to find that our normal
environment could prove so amusing, the Olympians would realise
our existence in their remote eyries of thought, and would send
us, stricken with barren germs of revolt, to our uneventful
beds.</p>
<p>On me, as the youngest of the brothers, the nightly shock
should have fallen lightly; for I was but newly emancipated from
the shameful ordeal of going to bed for an hour in the afternoon,
and I could very well remember, though I pretended I had <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>forgotten,
the sensations of that drowsy hour, when the birds sang so loudly
outside the window and the sun thrust fingers of dusty gold
through the crannies of the blind.&nbsp; I should therefore
probably have been reconciled to the common lot, which spelt
advancement to me, had I not newly discovered the joy of dreaming
those dreams that men have written in books for the delight of
the young.&nbsp; The Olympians were funny about books.&nbsp; They
gave them to us, or at the least smiled graciously when other
people gave them to us, but the moment rarely arrived when they
could endure to see us reading, or spoiling our eyes as their
dreadful phrase ran.&nbsp; And especially at nightfall, when the
shadows crept in from the corners of the room and made the pages
of the dullest book exciting, it was inviting an early bed-time
to be detected in the act of reading.&nbsp; As sure as the frog
was about to turn into a prince or the black enchantress had
appeared with her embarrassing christening present, the book
would be taken from my hands and I would be threatened with the
compulsory wearing of old-maidish spectacles&mdash;an end <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>that would
make me an object of derision in the eyes of man.&nbsp; And even
if I shut the book of my own accord, and sat nodding before the
fire, working out the story in my own fashion with some one I
knew very well to play the part of hero, some ruthless adult
would accuse me of being &ldquo;half asleep already,&rdquo; and
the veil of illusion would be torn beyond repair.</p>
<p>In winter-time the bedroom would seem cold after the
comfortable kingdom of the hearth-rug, and the smell of scented
soap was a poor substitute for the friendly fragrance of burning
logs.&nbsp; So we would undress as quickly as possible, and lie
cuddled up in the chilly bed-clothes, holding our own cold feet
in our hands as if they belonged to somebody else.&nbsp; But if
it happened that one of us had a bad cold, and there was a fire
in the bedroom, we would keep high festival, sitting in solemn
palaver round the camp-fire, and toasting our pink toes like
Arctic explorers, while the invalid lay in bed crowing over his
black-currant tea or hot lemonade.&nbsp; It was pleasant, too,
when natural weariness had driven us to <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>our beds,
to lie there and watch the firelight laughing on the walls; and
the invalid, for the time being, was rather a popular person.</p>
<p>In summer-time getting into bed was a far more complex
process, for the youth of the night held us wakeful; and if the
weather were warm, bed was an undesirable place as soon as we had
exhausted such coolness as lingered in the sheets.&nbsp; Then we
would devote ourselves to pillow-fighting, which was, I think, a
more humorous sport for elder brothers than for younger, or we
would express our firm intention of sleeping all night on the
floor under tents made of the bedclothes.&nbsp; The best of this
resolution was that it made bed seem so comfortable, when we
climbed back after the first fine romance of camping-out had worn
off.&nbsp; Thunderstorms we loved with a love not untouched by
awe, and we would huddle together at the window, measuring the
lightning, appraising the thunder, and listening to the cool
thresh of the rain on the garden below.</p>
<p>There were rare nights&mdash;nights of great winds&mdash;when
we would suddenly realise that <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>fear had entered into the room, and
that, after all, we were children in a world of men.&nbsp; Our
efforts to talk resulted in tremulous whispers that bred fear
rather than allayed it, and though we would not even then admit
it, we knew that we were possessed with a great loneliness.&nbsp;
Sooner or later some cunning spirit would suggest a pilgrimage to
the realms of the Olympians, and treading the warm stair-carpet
with our bare feet, we would journey till we heard the comforting
sound of their laughter and the even murmur of their
conversation.&nbsp; Sometimes we would stay there till we grew
sleepy, and the fear passed away, so that we could tiptoe back to
bed, wondering a little at ourselves; sometimes the Olympians
would discover us, and comfort our timid hearts with rough words
and sweet biscuits.&nbsp; In the morning we would pretend that
the whole business had been only an adventure, and we were not
above bragging of our courage in daring the ire of the grown-up
people.&nbsp; But we knew better.</p>
<h2><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>STREET-ORGANS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is very true, as Mr. Chesterton
must have remarked somewhere, that the cult of simplicity is one
of the most complex inventions of civilisation.&nbsp; To eat nuts
in a meadow when you can eat a beefsteak in a restaurant is
neither simple nor primitive; it is merely perverse, in the same
way that the art of Gauguin is perverse.&nbsp; A shepherd-boy
piping to his flock in Arcady and a poet playing the penny
whistle in a Soho garret may make the same kind of noise; but
whereas the shepherd-boy knows no better, the poet has to pretend
that he knows no better.&nbsp; So I reject scornfully the support
of those amateurs who profess to like street-organs because they
are the direct descendants of the itinerant ballad-singers of the
romantic past; or because they represent the simple musical
tastes of the majority <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>to-day.&nbsp; I refuse to believe
that in appreciating the sound of the complex modern instruments
dragged across London by Cockneys disguised as Italians the soul
of the primitive man who lurks in some dim oubliette of
everybody&rsquo;s consciousness is in any way comforted.&nbsp; I
should imagine that that poor prisoner, if civilisation&rsquo;s
cruelty has not deprived him of the faculty of hearing, is best
pleased by such barbaric music as the howling of the wind or the
sound of railway-engines suffering in the night; and indeed every
one must have noticed that sometimes certain sounds unmusical in
themselves can arouse the same emotions as the greatest
music.</p>
<p>But it is not on this score that street-organs escape our
condemnation; their music has certain defects that even distance
cannot diminish, and they invariably give us the impression of a
man speaking through his nose in a high-pitched voice, without
ever pausing to take breath.&nbsp; If, in spite of this, we have
a kindness for them, it is because of their association with the
gladdest moments of childhood.&nbsp; To the adult ear <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>they bring
only desolation and distraction, but to the children the
organ-man, with his curly black hair and his glittering earrings,
seems to be trailing clouds of glory.&nbsp; For them the
barrel-organ combines the merits of Wagner, Beethoven, Strauss,
and Debussy, and Orpheus would have to imitate its eloquent
strains on his lute if he wished to captivate the hearts of
London children.</p>
<p>When I was a child the piano-organ and that terrible variant
that reproduces the characteristic stutter of the mandoline with
deadly fidelity were hardly dreamed of, but the ordinary
barrel-organ and the prehistoric hurdy-gurdy, whose quavering
notes suggested senile decay, satisfied our natural craving for
melody.&nbsp; It is true that they did not make so much noise as
the modern instruments, but in revenge they were almost
invariably accompanied by a monkey in a little red coat or a
performing bear.&nbsp; I always had a secret desire to turn the
handle of the organ myself; and when&mdash;too late in life to
enjoy the full savour of the feat&mdash;I persuaded a wandering
musician to let me make the experiment, I was surprised to find
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>that it
is not so easy as it looks to turn the handle without jerking it,
and that the arm of the amateur is weary long before the
repertoire of the organ is exhausted.&nbsp; It is told of
Mascagni that he once taught an organ-man how to play his
notorious Intermezzo to the fullest effect; but I fancy that in
professional circles the story would be discredited, for the arm
of the practised musician acquires by force of habit a uniform
rate of revolution, and in endeavouring to modify that rate he
would lose all control over his instrument.</p>
<p>Personally, I do not like hearing excerpts from Italian opera
on the street-organs, because that is not the kind of music that
children can dance to, and it is, after all, in supplying an
orchestra for the ballroom of the street that they best justify
their existence.&nbsp; The spectacle of little ragged children
dancing to the music of the organ is the prettiest and merriest
and saddest thing in the world.&nbsp; In France and Belgium they
waltz; in England they have invented a curious compound of the
reel, the gavotte, and the cakewalk.&nbsp; The best dancers in <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>London are
always little Jewesses, and it is worth anybody&rsquo;s while to
go to Whitechapel at midday to see Miriam dancing on the cobbles
of Stoney Lane.&nbsp; There is not, as I once thought, a thwarted
enchanter shut up inside street-organs who cries out when the
handle turns in the small of his back.&nbsp; But why is it that I
feel instinctively that magicians have drooping moustaches and
insinuating smiles, if it is not that my mind as a child founded
its conception of magicians on itinerant musicians?&nbsp; And
they weave powerful spells, strong enough to make these poor
little atomies forget their birthright of want and foot it like
princesses.&nbsp; Children approach their amusements with a
gravity beside which the work of a man&rsquo;s life seems
deplorably flippant.&nbsp; A baby toddling round a bandstand is a
far more impressive sight than a grown man circumnavigating the
world, and children do not smile when they dance&mdash;all the
laughter is in their feet.</p>
<p>When from time to time &ldquo;brain-workers&rdquo; write to
the newspapers to suggest that street musicians should be
suppressed I feel <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>that the hour has almost come to start a movement in
favour of Votes for Children.&nbsp; It is disgraceful, ladies and
gentlemen, that this important section of the community, on whom
the whole future of the nation depends, should have no voice in
the forming of the nation&rsquo;s laws!&nbsp; This question of
street-organs cannot be solved by banishing them to the slums
without depriving many children of a legitimate pleasure.&nbsp;
For, <i>sub rosa</i>, the children of Park Lane&mdash;if there
are any children in Park Lane&mdash;and even the children of
&ldquo;brain-workers,&rdquo; appreciate the music of street
organs quite as much as their humble contemporaries.&nbsp; While
father buries his head under the sofa-cushions and composes
furious letters to the <i>Times</i> in that stuffy hermitage,
little noses are pressed against the window-pane, little hands
applaud, and little feet beat time on the nursery floor
upstairs.&nbsp; This is one of those situations where it is
permissible to sympathise with all parties, and unless father can
achieve an almost inhuman spirit of tolerance I see no
satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>For children must have music; they must <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>have tunes
to think to and laugh to and live to.&nbsp; Funeral marches to
the grave are all very well for the elderly and disillusioned,
but youth must tread a more lively measure.&nbsp; And this music
should come like the sunshine in winter, surprisingly, at no
fixed hour, as though it were a natural consequence of
life.&nbsp; One of the gladdest things about the organ-man in our
childhood was the unexpectedness of his coming.&nbsp; Life would
be dragging a little in schoolroom circles, when suddenly we
would hear the organ clearing its throat as it were; we would all
run to the window to wave our hands to the smiling musician, and
shout affectionate messages to his intelligent monkey, who caught
our pennies in his little pointed cap.&nbsp; In those days we had
all made up our minds that when we grew up we would have an organ
and a monkey of our own.&nbsp; I think it is rather a pity that
with age we forget these lofty resolutions of our
childhood.&nbsp; I have formed a conception of the ideal
street-organist that would only be fulfilled by some one who had
realised the romance of that calling in their youth.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>How
often, when the children have been happiest and the dance has
been at its gayest, I have seen the organ-man fold music&rsquo;s
wings and move on to another pitch in search of pennies!&nbsp; I
should like to think that it is a revolt against this degraded
commercialism that inspires the protests of the critics of street
music.&nbsp; The itinerant musician who believed in art for
art&rsquo;s sake would never move on so long as he had an
appreciative audience; and sometimes, though I am afraid this
would be the last straw to the &ldquo;brain-workers,&rdquo; he
would arrive at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and the
children, roused from their sleep, would hear Pan piping to his
moonlit flocks, and would believe that they were still in the
pleasant country of dreams.</p>
<h2><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>A
SECRET SOCIETY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that the Houndsditch affair has
been laid aside by the man in the street and it is once more
possible for a bearded Englishman to tread the pavements of
London without reproach, I may perhaps venture to give some
account of a secret society with which I have been intimately
connected, without earning the reputation of a monger of
sensations.</p>
<p>Some four or five years ago I met a picturesque journalist who
told me that he had once been at pains to worm out the secrets of
an anarchist society in London, and had incorporated his
discoveries in a volume so marvellous that no editor or publisher
would believe it.&nbsp; I only remember one incident of all his
wonderful adventures.&nbsp; He was led by an anarchist comrade
into a small shop in the Strand, thence into a <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>cellar, and
thence along a series of passages and caverns that ultimately
brought him out in Seven Dials!&nbsp; Even Mr. Chesterton&rsquo;s
detective-anarchists in the &ldquo;Man who was Thursday&rdquo;
could not beat this.&nbsp; For my part I shall not try, but shall
content myself with a straightforward narration of facts.</p>
<p>I should think it was about last July that I first noticed
that the children of my neighbourhood, with whom I have some
small acquaintance, were endeavouring to assume a sinister
aspect, and were wearing a cryptic button with a marked air of
secrecy.&nbsp; When I came out for my morning walk the front
garden would be animated with partially concealed children like
the park in Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;They,&rdquo; and though I
have long realised that suburban front gardens do not lend
themselves to the higher horticulture, I felt the natural
embarrassment of the man who does not know whether he is expected
to expel trespassers or welcome bashful visitors.&nbsp; In the
circumstances I affected not to notice that the lilac was
murmurous with ill-suppressed laughter and that the laurels were
waving tumultuously; but it was <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>hardly reassuring to discover on my
return that a large red cross and the letters T. S. had been
chalked on my gate by an unknown hand.&nbsp; For a moment I
wondered whether the children had been reading &ldquo;Sentimental
Tommy,&rdquo; for these were the initials and the methods of Mr.
Barrie&rsquo;s luckless hero, but the age and genial contempt for
scholarship of the investing forces made this unlikely.&nbsp; On
the fourth day, finding one of the band momentarily separated
from her comrades, I ventured a <i>coup d&rsquo;etat</i>.&nbsp;
Pointing to the letters on her secret button, I remarked,
&ldquo;I see you belong to the Teapot Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&rdquo; she said indignantly;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the Terror Society I belong to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secret was out, but I thought it wiser to conceal my
triumph.&nbsp; Evidently, however, my discovery troubled the
band, for next morning I received a <i>soi-disant</i> anonymous
letter of caution signed in full by all the members.&nbsp; I felt
that the moment had arrived for definite action, especially as
the cat who honours my house with his presence, and whose summer
morning <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>basking-place is in the front garden, had been much
upset by this recurrent invasion of his privacy.&nbsp; I wrote a
humble letter to the Society, apologising for my crimes and
begging that I might be allowed to become a member, and placed it
outside on the path.&nbsp; Five minutes later two very
unembarrassed children appeared in my study, and introduced
themselves as Captain and Secretary of the Terror Society.</p>
<p>The Captain was very frank with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we didn&rsquo;t really want to frighten
you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but we had to get you to become a
member somehow or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not much good at
conspiracies,&rdquo; I said modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; the Captain
answered kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can be honourable
Treasurer.&nbsp; You know we want a lot of things for our
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to see what part I had in the scheme of things.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are the rules of the Society?&rdquo; I asked in all
innocence, and thereby flung the Secretary into confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, she wrote them out,&rdquo; the Captain <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>explained,
&ldquo;and she doesn&rsquo;t want you to read them because of the
spelling.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re only make-up rules, so you
needn&rsquo;t bother about them.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you want to
see the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; I said firmly, &ldquo;it is my one
wish.&nbsp; Lead on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought really to be blindfolded,&rdquo; the Captain
whispered to me as we went along, &ldquo;but I used my
handkerchief to wrap up some of cook&rsquo;s toffee this morning,
and it&rsquo;s rather sticky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologise,&rdquo; I murmured hastily;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind not being blindfolded a bit.&nbsp;
Besides, I&rsquo;m practically a member, and you mustn&rsquo;t
blindfold members; it isn&rsquo;t done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain seemed relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew you would
make a good treasurer,&rdquo; she said with cheerful
inconsequence.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, look! there&rsquo;s the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The headquarters or club-house of the Terror Society stood
beside the allotment gardens at the top of the hill, and may, at
some less honourable period of its history, have served as a
place for storing tools.&nbsp; In the course of their
trespassings the <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>children had found it lying empty, and had obtained
permission from the landlord to have it for their very own.&nbsp;
I have implied that the feminine element was predominant in the
Society, and, recalling the wigwams and log huts of my own
childhood, the difference between the ideals of boys and girls
was sharply brought home to me when I crossed the
threshold.&nbsp; The walls were papered with sentimental pictures
out of Christmas numbers and literally draped with curtains;
there were vases filled with flowers in every corner, and in the
middle of this boudoir three of the members were drinking
tea.&nbsp; In a sense, perhaps, the girls were to be commended
for finding the true romance in domesticity, but I could not help
wondering what Captain Shark of the barque <i>Rapacious</i>, that
faithful friend of my boyhood, would have thought of a Terror
Society run on such principles.&nbsp; However, I saw that the
eyes of the members were upon me, and I hastened to do my duty as
an honourable member.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;How on earth did you manage to do it all
yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>The
children all fell to apportioning the credit&mdash;all, that is,
save the Captain, who seemed to me a very businesslike
fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Treasurer,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we want
some more of those camp-stools and a lock to keep out burglars,
and some knives and forks, and a tin of biscuits and a pail and
candles and a candlestick and a clothes-brush and a little bell
to ring at dinner-time and a knocker for the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately she paused to take breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Captain,&rdquo; I interrupted quickly, &ldquo;I
have a sovereign in the savings-bank, and if you come with me
to-morrow we&rsquo;ll draw it out, and do the best we can with
the money.&nbsp; But tell me, am I really a member?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where&rsquo;s my mysterious button?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain frowned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jessie will have to paint
you one, but the ribbon costs a penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes twenty shillings and a penny,&rdquo; said
the Secretary.&nbsp; It was indeed a businesslike Society.</p>
<p>The next day the Captain and I did a lot <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>of
miscellaneous shopping, and two days later the button was left at
my door by a small boy.&nbsp; Then for a fortnight I heard
nothing of the Society or its members, and no sinister invasion
of the morning occurred to disturb the far peace in the eyes of
my cat.&nbsp; At last I met the Captain in the road, and though
she endeavoured to elude me, I succeeded in getting her into a
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s the
Terror Society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain looked gloomy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you
heard?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Terror Society is all
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finished already!&rdquo; I cried in astonishment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, what have you done with the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been given to another society,&rdquo; she said
without a blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Horror Society.&nbsp; I am Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered this news for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I
suppose I&rsquo;m a member of the new society?&rdquo; I
ventured.</p>
<p>The Captain shook her head sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>so
sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but the H. S. has a rule that no
grown-ups are admitted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is why, though I myself was a member of the Terror
Society, I yet feel myself at liberty to write about it.&nbsp;
For as on inquiry I discovered that the ranks of the Horror
Society differed in no wise from those of the Terror Society save
for the exclusion of the honourable Treasurer, I cannot help
feeling that I have been rather badly treated.</p>
<h2><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>THE
PRICE OF PEACE</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">cannot</span> remember how old I was
when I wrote the thrilling poem about the tiger who swallowed the
horse, nor am I quite certain that it was my first literary
effort, but I know that I was still at the tight knickerbocker
stage, and that my previous poems, if there had been any, had
remained secrets of my own.&nbsp; It was due to a cousin that my
conspiracy against the world of common sense was finally
discovered.&nbsp; Woman-like, she tickled my ears with flattery,
and persuaded me to let her read the precious document; and then,
as soon as she had it in her hand, she fled to the camp of the
Olympians, leaving me alone in the little dark room to reflect on
the guiles of the sex.&nbsp; With straining ears I waited for the
distant chorus of mocking laughter that would announce my
failure, while my body <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>tingled all over with shame.&nbsp;
Yet beneath my fear I was conscious that I had not been wholly
unwilling to be betrayed.&nbsp; It seemed to me that if I proved
to be a great poet, my future traffic with the Olympians might be
of a more agreeable character than it had been previously.&nbsp;
On the other hand, I felt that life would be impossible if they
greeted my poem with scorn.&nbsp; Conceived and perfected in
solitude, it had become an intimate part of myself, and I turned
dark thoughts to the purple berries that grew in the shrubbery,
and provided us with wholly innocuous poison for our
arrows.&nbsp; Even then, it would seem, I had an instinctive
knowledge of the tragedy of failing as a poet.</p>
<p>And then, while I yet waited in suspense, I heard the sound of
footsteps and knew that my cousin was returning.&nbsp; In a flash
I realised how stupid I had been to remain in the room, when I
might have hidden myself in some far corner of the attic and
appeared no more until my shame had been forgotten.&nbsp; My legs
trembled in sudden panic, and it seemed to me that my face was
ticking like a clock.&nbsp; I received my first <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>critic with
my head buried in the cushions of the sofa.</p>
<p>Looking back, I perceive that the Olympians rose to the
occasion, but at the time I could hardly believe my
good-fortune.&nbsp; Long after my cousin had gone away I lay on
the sofa turning over the pleasant message in my mind&mdash;and
the magic half-crown in my hand.&nbsp; Praise I had desired, if
not expected; but that the Olympians&mdash;whose function in life
was to divert our tips into a savings-bank account that meant
nothing to us, that these stern financiers should give me a whole
half-crown in one sum, unhindered by any restrictions in the
spending, was incredible.&nbsp; Yet I could feel its rough edge
in the dark; and considering its source, I formed an erroneous
idea of the influence of the arts on the minds of sane grown-up
people, from which even now I am not wholly delivered.</p>
<p>After a while, with a mind strangely confused between pride
and modesty, I stole into the room where the others were
sitting.&nbsp; But with a quick sense of disappointment I saw
that I need not have concerned <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>myself at all with the proper
attitude for a young poet to adopt.&nbsp; The Olympians, engaged
in one of their meaningless discussions, did not notice my
entrance, and only my brothers were interested when I crept
silently into their midst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to spend it on?&rdquo; they
whispered.</p>
<p>Oddly, for I was the youngest of four, this success of mine
was responsible for a literary outburst in our normally
uncultured schoolroom, and one of the fruits of that intellectual
disturbance, in the shape of a manuscript magazine, lies before
me.&nbsp; It contains an editorial address to the &ldquo;friendly
reader,&rdquo; two short stories full of murders, a quantity of
didactic verse, and the first instalment of a serial, which
commences gravely: &ldquo;My father was a bootmaker of
considerable richness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of literary achievement or
even promise it would be hard to find a trace in these yellowing
pages, but there is an enthusiasm behind every line of them that
the critic would seek in vain in modern journalism.&nbsp; Indeed,
those were the days in which to write, when paper and <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>pencil and
half an hour never failed to produce a masterpiece, and the
finished work invariably thrilled the artist with
&ldquo;out-landish pride.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot recall that any
further half-crowns rewarded our efforts, and possibly that is
the reason why three of the four boys who wrote that magazine are
now regenerate and write no more.</p>
<p>And even the fourth must own to having lost that fine,
careless trick of throwing off masterpieces, and to regretting,
in moments of depression, the generous Olympian impulse that
enabled him to barter his birthright of common sense for a silver
coin with a rough edge.&nbsp; And the Olympians&mdash;they, too,
have regretted it, I suppose, for the goddess of letters is an
exacting mistress, and we do not willingly see our children
engaging in her irregular service.&nbsp; Yet I do not see what
else they could have done at the time.</p>
<p>A little while ago I discovered a small girl, to whom I act as
a kind of illegal uncle, in the throes of lyrical
composition.&nbsp; With soft words and flattering phrases,
borrowed, perhaps, from the cousin of the past, I won the paper
from her grasp.&nbsp; It was like all <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>the poetry that children have ever
written, and I was preparing to banter the young author when I
saw that she was regarding me with curious intentness, and that
her face turned red and white by turns.&nbsp; Even if my
intentions had been honourable I could not have disregarded her
signs of distress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very nice
indeed,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you half a crown
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As her fingers closed on the coin I felt inclined to raise a
shout of triumph.&nbsp; For now that I had paid the half-crown
back I should be able gradually&mdash;for, of course, the habit
of years is not broken in a minute&mdash;to stop writing.&nbsp;
My only fear is that my conscience may have gone to sleep in my
long years of aloofness from simplicity; for though I already
detect a note of vagueness in the eyes of my niece, and her
mother complains that she is becoming untidy, I hold my peace,
and offer no explanation.&nbsp; For I feel sure that if I did I
should recover my half-crown.</p>
<h2><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>ON
CHILDREN&rsquo;S GARDENS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the well-ordered garden of every
well-ordered house&mdash;that is, every house that numbers
children in its treasury&mdash;there lies, screened perhaps by
some inconvenient shrubbery but none the less patent to the stars
and the winds and the polite visitor, a tormented patch of earth
where sway in dubious security of tenure a number of sickly
plants.&nbsp; For days they have lain parched and neglected in
the summer sun; for days they have been beaten down into a morass
by torrents poured from an excited watering-pot; their roots have
regarded heaven for no less a period than their heads; and in the
face of such unnatural conditions Ceres, one fancies, must have
fallen back in confusion and left them to struggle on as best
they can unaided.&nbsp; It is only the most hardy <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>of plants
that may survive the attentions of a youthful gardener, and it is
a tribute to Nature&rsquo;s obstinacy that any survive at
all.&nbsp; I have in my mind a garden of this kind, and thereby
hangs one of those rather tragic stories which grown-up people
are apt to consider funny.&nbsp; The garden lay below an old
brick wall, which must, I think, have faced south, for, as I
remember it, it was always lit by the sun.&nbsp; It was the
property of three children, and their separate estates were
carefully marked off by decorative walls of shells and freakish
pebbles.&nbsp; Here, early and late, two of the children waged a
gallant war against Nature, thwarting and checking her with a
hundred delicate attentions; but on the third had fallen that
pleasant mood when it is nicer to lie in the shade and to dream
of wine than to labour in the vineyard.&nbsp; His garden was a
tangle of weeds and of healthy, neglected plants, and when the
inevitable awakening came he saw that it would require days of
unprofitable work to turn the wilderness into a proper
garden.&nbsp; Yet to hear the uninformed comparisons of visitors
was a shameful ordeal not to be <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>borne.&nbsp; He solved the problem,
I still think, in a very spirited manner.&nbsp; He cleared the
garden by the simple process of removing plants and weeds alike,
and sowed the ground with seeds, purchased alas! with a shilling
extracted quite illegally from his money-box.&nbsp; But the
secrecy of these movements had not escaped the notice of the
Olympians, and later there fell on his horrified ears an entirely
new and obviously truthful theory of botany; it seemed that the
word &ldquo;thief&rdquo; could be plainly deciphered on the
flowers of dishonest gardeners.&nbsp; There were no blossoms in
that little boy&rsquo;s garden that year.&nbsp; Like the monk in
Browning&rsquo;s poem, he pinched off all the buds before the sun
was up.</p>
<p>They were simple flowers we sought to cultivate in those days,
simple flowers with beautiful names.&nbsp; Violets and snowdrops,
the reticent but cheerful pansy, otherwise known as &ldquo;three
faces under a hood,&rdquo; love-lies-bleeding, wallflowers,
stocks, and London pride, or &ldquo;none so pretty&rdquo;; of
these and their unaffected comrades we made our gardens.&nbsp;
Spades and pickaxes were denied us, but the <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>simple
gardening tools were ours, and he has lived in darkness who has
not experienced the keen joy of smacking the earth with the
convex side of a trowel.&nbsp; My hands tingle when I remember
how sore weeding made the finger-tips, and there is something in
the last ecstatic chuckle of a watering-pot as it runs dry that
lingers in the ear.&nbsp; I am aware that there are persons of
mature years who can find pleasure in the performance of simple
garden tasks.&nbsp; But I am afraid that subconsciously it is the
&aelig;sthetic aspect of flowers that attracts them, and that
their gardening is only a means to an end.&nbsp; No such charge
could be brought against our efforts.&nbsp; We cared little about
flowers or results of any sort; we only wanted to garden, and it
troubled us not at all that the labours of one day destroyed
those of the day before.&nbsp; To dig a deep hole and to fill it
with water when completed is, as far as I have observed, no part
of the ordinary gardener&rsquo;s daily work, but it was our
favourite effort, and a share in the construction of these
ornamental waters was the greatest favour that we could grant to
a <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>friend.&nbsp; There were always captivating insects
with numerous and casual legs to be discovered in the digging,
and great stones that parted from the earth as reluctantly as
nuggets.&nbsp; And when we had hollowed a cup in the earth we
would pour in the sea and set our hearts floating upon its
surface in paper ships.&nbsp; The sides of the hole would crumble
down into the water like real cliffs, and every little fall would
send a real wave sparkling across the surface of the ocean.&nbsp;
Then there were bays to be cut and canals, and soundings to be
taken with pieces of knotted string weighted with stones.&nbsp;
Water has been the friend of children ever since Moses floated in
his little ark of rushes to the feet of Pharaoh&rsquo;s
daughter.</p>
<p>I question whether they know very much about this sort of
gardening at Kew, a place which is, however, beloved of children
for the sake of the excellent spiral staircases in the
palm-houses.&nbsp; But every sensible child has the art at its
finger-tips, and in the time that we take to reach Brighton in a
fleet motor they will construct a brand new sea for
themselves&mdash;a sea with harbours and <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>islands and
sunken reefs, a perfect sea of wonder and romance.</p>
<p>If we are prepared to set aside our preconceived ideas as to
what a garden ought to be, we must own that the children are not
far wrong after all.&nbsp; A garden is only a world in miniature,
with prairies of flowers and forests of roses and gravel paths
for the wide, dusty roads.&nbsp; When we plant flowers in our
garden it is as though we added new territories to our empire,
new reds and blues and purples to our treasury of colours.&nbsp;
And so when a child has wrought a fine morning&rsquo;s havoc in
its little patch of ground it has added it may be an ocean, it
may be only a couple of stars to the kingdom of imagination which
we may no longer see.&nbsp; It only needs a sunny hour or two, a
trowel, and a pair of dirty hands to change a few square yards of
earth into a world.&nbsp; And the child may be considered
fortunate in being able to express itself perfectly in terms of
dust.&nbsp; Our books and pictures cumber the earth, our palaces
strike the skies, and yet it is our common tragedy that we have
not found expression; while <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>down the garden behind the
lilac-bushes at this very moment Milton may have developed
Lycidas into a sticky marsh, and Shakespeare may have compressed
Hamlet into a mud-pie.&nbsp; The works of the children end as
they begin in dust; but we cannot pretend that ours are more
permanent.</p>
<h2><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>A
DISTINGUISHED GUEST</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> willing to acknowledge that
until lately, when I was privileged to entertain a cat under my
roof for a fortnight, my knowledge of these noble beings was only
academic.&nbsp; I had read what the poets have to say about
them&mdash;Wordsworth and Swinburne, Cowper and Gray; I knew that
&ldquo;cat&rdquo; was the only word in the English language that
had a vocative, &ldquo;puss&rdquo;; I knew that Southey mourned
that his kitten should ever attain to cathood, that the Egyptians
were very fond of cats and that Lord Roberts is not.&nbsp; Then I
had seen cats in the street, and admired the spirit with which a
homeless cat with no visible means of subsistence would put shame
into the heart of a well-fed terrier.&nbsp; Lying awake by night
I had heard their barbaric song ringing like a challenge in the
ears of civilisation, and had <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>wondered whether some unknown
Strauss might not revolutionise the music of the future by aid of
their passionate harmonies.&nbsp; But I had never moved in their
society, and therefore I would not understand them.&nbsp; In
those days I should probably have thought that the recent message
of the Postmaster-General to the Press, to the effect that cats
of the old General Post Office had been found comfortable homes,
was trivial.&nbsp; And I remember with shame that I watched the
malevolent antics of the caricature of a cat that appears in the
&ldquo;Blue Bird&rdquo; without indignation.</p>
<p>I do not propose to give the events of the fortnight in
detail, but rather to summarise them for the benefit of others
who, like myself, may be called upon unexpectedly to entertain a
feline guest.&nbsp; The name of my visitor was Kim, though I am
told that most cats are called William Pitt, after the
statesman.&nbsp; He was a short-haired tabby cat, some eighteen
months old, and a fine, large fellow for his age.&nbsp; While he
was with me he usually wore a white waistcoat, and there was a
white mark on his face, as if some <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>milk had been spilled there when he
was a kitten.&nbsp; His eyes were very large and of the colour of
stage sunlight, and they haunted me from the moment when I raised
the lid of the hamper in which he arrived.&nbsp; They were always
significant and always inscrutable, but I could not help staring
into them in the hope of discovering their meaning.&nbsp; I think
he knew they fascinated me, for he would keep them wide open and
full of secrets for hours at a time.</p>
<p>I had been informed that his name was Kim because he was the
little friend of all the world, but at the first I found him
reticent and of an independent disposition.&nbsp; I had always
believed that cats purred when you stroked them, but when I
stroked him he would endure it in silence for a minute and then
retire to a corner of the room and make an elaborate and, under
the circumstances, uncomplimentary toilet.&nbsp; In my
inexperience I was afraid that he had taken a dislike to me, but
one evening, after he had been with me three days, he climbed
into my lap and went to sleep.&nbsp; My pipe was on the
mantelpiece, and as Kim weighed <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>over twelve pounds my legs grew very
cramped; but I knew better than to disturb him, and he slept very
comfortably till two in the morning.&nbsp; He repeated this
compliment on several occasions, but when I lifted him into my
lap he always got off immediately, and made me feel that I had
been ill-treating him.&nbsp; His choice of sleeping-places was
strange.&nbsp; If I was reading, he waited till I laid the book
down on the table and then fell asleep on top of it.&nbsp; When I
was writing and he had grown weary of turning his head from side
to side to follow the birdlike flight of the pen to the ink-pot,
he loved to settle himself down on the wet manuscript and blink
drowsily at my embarrassment.&nbsp; Once when I ventured to lift
him off he sulked under the table all the afternoon, and I did
not repeat the experiment.&nbsp; He seemed to be a very sensitive
cat.</p>
<p>Of course he was too old to play with me, but he had famous
games by himself with corks and pieces of paper.&nbsp; Sooner or
later he would drive these under one of the bookcases, and would
sit down and mew <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>plaintively until I went and raked them out for
him.&nbsp; Then he would get up and walk away as if such toys
were beneath his dignity.&nbsp; The one fault I found in his
character was this constant emphasis of an inferiority that I was
quite willing to confess.&nbsp; A generous cat would have
realised that I was trying to do my best, and would have pardoned
my hundred errors of judgment.&nbsp; Kim never wearied of putting
me in my place, and turned a scornful tail to my heartfelt
apologies.&nbsp; When he was dozing in the evening on the
hearthrug he was very angry if any one put coals on the fire,
even though he had been warned beforehand of what was about to
happen.&nbsp; He would look at me with an air of noble reproach
and stalk away to the window, where, perched on the back of a
window-seat, he would stay for hours, patiently observant of the
sounds and smells of the night.</p>
<p>But it was at mealtimes that he made me realise most the
strength of his individuality.&nbsp; I had imagined that all cats
were fond of milk, but Kim quickly disillusioned me, and it was
as the result of a series of experiments <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>that I
discovered that he would only drink new milk raised to a certain
temperature, and not then if he thought I was watching him.&nbsp;
For the first twenty-four hours after he arrived he would eat
nothing, though I tried to tempt him with chicken, sardines, and
fillet of sole.&nbsp; Once or twice he gave a little plaintive
mew, but for the most part he succeeded in giving me the
impression of a brave heart enduring the pangs of a consuming
hunger with noble fortitude.&nbsp; At the end of that period,
when he had reduced me to despair, he relieved himself and me by
stealing a haddock.&nbsp; After that the task of feeding him was
comparatively easy.&nbsp; I would prepare him a dinner and
pretend to eat it myself with great enjoyment; then I would leave
the room as if I had suddenly remembered an appointment.&nbsp;
When I returned the plate would be empty&mdash;that is, as empty
as a cat&rsquo;s dignity will allow him to leave a plate, and a
few delicate impressions of Kim&rsquo;s paws on the tablecloth
would tell me that all was well.&nbsp; The irritating motive that
underlay this graceless mannerism was clear to me.&nbsp; He would
not be <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>beholden to me for so much as a sardine, and he was
willing to steal all his meals so long as he could remain
independent.&nbsp; I think, too, that it amused him to undermine
my moral character by making me deceitful.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a cookery-book for cats is badly needed.&nbsp;
Unlike dogs, they are gourmets rather than gourmands, and their
appetites seem to languish if they do not have a continual change
of fare.&nbsp; They have subtle palates; Kim liked gorgonzola
cheese and curried rabbit, but he would not eat chicken in any
form.&nbsp; I found anchovy sauce very useful to make a meal
savoury that Kim had not thought palatable enough to steal, and
the wise host will hold this condiment in reserve for such
occasions.&nbsp; There is no relying on their likes or dislikes;
they will eat something with avidity one day and reject it with
infinite distaste the next.</p>
<p>On the whole it was a busy fortnight, and it was not without a
certain relief that I said farewell to my emotional guest and
sent him back to his owner.&nbsp; Designedly, as I believe, he
had succeeded in making me painfully self-conscious, so that I
could not do <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>anything without being led to feel that in some way I
was sinning against the laws of hospitality.&nbsp; It was
pleasant to realise that my life was once more my own, and that I
was free from the critical inspection of those significant,
inscrutable eyes.&nbsp; I have commented on the independence of
his character; it would be unjust if I failed to mention the one
exception.&nbsp; One night I was awakened by a soft paw, a paw
innocent of all claws, patting me gently on the cheek, and in the
dark I was aware of Kim sitting on my pillow.&nbsp; I supposed
that he was lonely and put up my hand to stroke him.&nbsp; Then
for once in a way the proudest of sentient beings was pleased to
drop the mask of his pride and purr loudly and without
restraint.&nbsp; In the morning he treated me with exaggerated
coldness, but I was not cheated into believing that his
friendliness had been a dream.&nbsp; There are possibilities
about Kim; and I believe that if he were to stop with me for two
years we should come to a very tolerable understanding.</p>
<h2><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>ON
PIRATES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the nameless classics which were
of so much concern to all of us when we were young, the most
important were certainly those salt and blusterous volumes that
told of pirates.&nbsp; It was in vain for kindly relatives to
give us books on Nelson and his like; for their craft, beautiful
though they might be to the eye, had ever the moralities lurking
between decks, and if we met them it was only that we might make
their crews walk the plank, and add new stores of guns and
treasure to the crimson vessel with the sinister flag which it
was our pleasure to command.</p>
<p>And yet the books that gave us this splendid dominion, where
are they now?&nbsp; In truth, I cannot say.&nbsp; Examination of
recent boys&rsquo; books has convinced me that <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>the old
spirit is lacking, for if pirates are there, it is only as the
hapless victims of horrible British crews with every virtue save
that one which youth should cherish most, the revolutionary
spirit.&nbsp; Who would be a midshipman when he might be a
pirate?&nbsp; Yet all the books would have it so, and even Mr.
Kenneth Grahame, who knows everything that is worth knowing, does
not always take the right side in such matters.&nbsp; The
grown-up books are equally unsatisfactory to the inquiring
mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Treasure Island,&rdquo; which is sometimes
loosely referred to as if it were a horn-book for young pirates,
hardly touches the main problems of pirate life at all.&nbsp;
Stevenson&rsquo;s consideration for &ldquo;youth and the fond
parient&rdquo; made him leave out all oaths.&nbsp; No ships are
taken, no lovely females captured, nobody walks the plank, and
Captain John Silver, for all the maimed strength and
masterfulness that Henley suggested to the author, falls
lamentably short of what a pirate should be.&nbsp; Captain Teach,
of the <i>Sarah</i>, in the &ldquo;Master of Ballantrae,&rdquo;
is better, and there were the makings of a very good pirate
captain <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>in the master himself, but this section of the book is
too short to supply our requirements.&nbsp; The book must be all
pirates.&nbsp; Defoe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Captain Singleton&rdquo;
repents and is therefore disqualified, and Marryat&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Pirate&rdquo; is, as Stevenson said, &ldquo;written in
sand with a saltspoon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Clark Russell, in one of
his romances, ingeniously melts a pirate who has been frozen for
a couple of centuries into life, but though he promises well at
first, his is but a torpid ferocity, and ends, as it began, in
words.&nbsp; Nor are the histories of the pirates more
satisfying.&nbsp; Captain Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of
Notorious Pirates&rdquo; I have not seen, but any one who wishes
to lose an illusion can read the trial of William Kidd and a few
of his companions in the State trials of the year 1701.&nbsp; The
captain of the <i>Adventure Galley</i> appears to have done
little to merit the name of pirate beyond killing his gunner with
a bucket, and the miserable results of his pilferings bear no
relationship to the enormous hoard associated with his name in
&ldquo;The Gold Bug&rdquo; of Poe, though there is certainly a
familiar note in finding included among his <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>captives a
number of barrels of sugar-candy, which were divided in shares
among the crew, the captain himself having forty shares.&nbsp;
The Turkish pirates mentioned in &ldquo;Purchas&rdquo; cut a very
poor figure.&nbsp; You can read there how four English youths
overcame a prize crew of thirteen men who had been put in the
ship <i>Jacob</i>.&nbsp; In a storm they slew the pirate captain,
for with the handle of a pump &ldquo;they gave him such a palt on
the pate as made his brains forsake the possession of his
head.&rdquo;&nbsp; They then killed three of the other pirates
with &ldquo;cuttleaxes,&rdquo; and brought the ship safely into
Spain, &ldquo;where they sold the nine Turkes for galley-slaves
for a good summe of money, and as I thinke, a great deale more
than they were worth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not thus would the chronicles
have described the pirates who fought and caroused with such
splendid devotion in my youth.&nbsp; To die beneath the handle of
a pump is an unworthy end for a pirate captain.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;History of the Buccaneers of America,&rdquo; written by a
brother of Fanny Burney, a book which was the subject of one of
Mr. Andrew Lang&rsquo;s <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>appreciative essays, is nearer the
mark, for among other notable fellows mentioned therein is one
Fran&ccedil;ois L&rsquo;Olonnois, who put to death the whole crew
of a Spanish ship, ninety men, by beheading them, performing
himself the office of executioner.&nbsp; One of the gentlemen in
this book turned buccaneer in order to pay his debts, while it is
told of another that he shot one of his crew in church for
behaving irreverently during Mass.&nbsp; Sir Henry Morgan and
Richard Sawkins performed some pretty feats of piracy, but their
main energies were concerned in the sacking of towns, and the
whole book suffers from an unaccountable prejudice which the
author displays against the brave and hard-working villains of
whom he writes.</p>
<p>In truth, these real pirates are disappointing men to
meet.&nbsp; They are usually lacking in fierceness and in
fidelity to the pirate ideals of courage and faithfulness to
their comrades, while the fine nobility of character which was
never absent from those other pirates is unknown in the
historical kind.&nbsp; Few, if any, of them merit the old <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Portuguese
punishment for pirates, which consisted in hanging them from the
yards of their own ship, and setting the latter to drift with the
winds and waves without rudder or sails, an example for rogues
and a source of considerable danger to honest mariners.</p>
<p>If that were a fitting end for great knaves, the meaner
ruffians must be content with the pump-handle and the bucket.</p>
<p>It is hard if our hearts may not go out to those gloomy
vessels, with their cargoes of gold and courage and rum, that
sail, it seems, the mental seas of youth no more.&nbsp; Were they
really bad for us, those sanguinary tussles, those star-lit
nights of dissipation?&nbsp; A pinafore would wipe away a deal of
blood, and the rum, though we might drink it boiling like Quilp,
in no wise lessened our interest in home-made cake.&nbsp; But
these regrets are of yesterday, and to-day I must draw what
consolation I may from the kindly comment of Mr. Lang:
&ldquo;Alluring as the pirate&rsquo;s profession is, we must not
forget that it had a seamy side, and was by no means all rum and
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>pieces-of-eight.&nbsp; And there is something repulsive
to a generous nature in roasting men because they will not show
you where to steal hogs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>THE
FLUTE-PLAYER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> used to play to me in the magic
hour before bedtime, when, in the summer, the red sun threw long
shadows across the lawn, and in winter the fire burned brighter
and brighter in the hearth.&nbsp; This was the hour when all the
interminable squabbles of the schoolroom were forgotten, and even
the noisiest of us would hush his voice to listen drowsily to a
fairy-tale, or to watch the palaces raise aloft their minarets,
and crumble to dull red ash in the heart of the fire.&nbsp; It
was then that I would see him sitting astride of the fireguard
and puffing out his cheeks over his shining flute.&nbsp; Even in
the most thrilling moments of fairy stories, when Cinderella lost
her crystal slipper or Sister Ann saw the cloud of dust from the
summit of Bluebeard&rsquo;s tower, his shrill melodies would ring
in my ears and <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>quicken my sleepy senses with the desire to hear more
of this enchanted music.&nbsp; I knew that it was real magic, but
I did not find it strange, because as far as I knew I had heard
it all my life.&nbsp; Perhaps he had played to me when I yet lay
in my cradle, and watched the night-light winking on the nursery
ceiling; but I did not try to remember whether this was so.&nbsp;
I was content to accept my strange musician as a fact of my
existence, and to feel a sense of loss on the rare evenings when
he failed me.&nbsp; I did not know how to dance, but sometimes I
would tap my feet on the floor in time to the music, till some
one would tell me not to fidget.&nbsp; For no one else would
either see him or hear him, which proved that it was real magic,
and flattered my sense of possession.&nbsp; It was evident that
he came for me alone.</p>
<p>The years passed, and in due course the imaginative graces of
my childhood were destroyed by the boys of my own age at
school.&nbsp; They compelled me to exchange a hundred star-roofed
palaces, three distinct kingdoms of dreams, and my enchanted <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>flute-player for a threadbare habit of mimicry that
left me cold and unprotected from the winds in the large places
of life.&nbsp; There was something at once pathetic and
ridiculous in our childish efforts to imitate our elders, but as
it seemed that our masters and grown-up relatives were in the
conspiracy to make us materialistically wise before our time, a
boy would have needed a rare force of character to linger with
his childhood and refuse to ape the man.&nbsp; So, for a while, I
saw my glad musician no more, though sometimes I thought I heard
him playing far away, and the child within me was warmed and
encouraged even while my new-found manhood was condemning the
weakness.&nbsp; I knew now that no man worthy of the name was
escorted through life by a fairy flute-player, and that dreamers
and wool-gatherers invariably sank to be poets and musicians,
persons who wear bowler-hats with frock-coats, have no crease in
their trousers, and come to a bad end.&nbsp; Fortunately, all
education that is repressive rather than stimulating is only
skin-deep, and it was inevitable that sooner or later I should <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>meet the
flute-player again.&nbsp; One Saturday afternoon in high summer I
avoided cricket and went for a long walk in the woods, moved by a
spirit of revolt against all the traditions and conventions of
boy-life; and presently, in a mossy clearing, all splashed and
wetted by little pools of sunlight, I found him playing to an
audience of two squirrels and a redstart.&nbsp; When he saw me he
winked the eye that glittered over his parading fingers, as
though he had left me only five minutes before, but I had not
listened long before I realised that I must pay the price of my
infidelity.&nbsp; It was the old music and the old magic, but try
as I might I could not hear it so clearly as I had when I was a
child.&nbsp; The continuity of my faith had been broken, and
though he was willing to forgive, I myself could not forget those
dark years of doubt and denial; and while I often met him in the
days that followed, I never won back to the old childish
intimacy.&nbsp; I sought his company eagerly and listened
passionately to his piping, but I was conscious now that this was
a strange thing, and sometimes when he <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>saw by my
eyes that I was moved by wonder rather than by the love of
beauty, he would put his flute in his pocket and disappear.&nbsp;
The world is an enchanted place only to the incurious and
tranquil-minded.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though like all boys I had been forced to
discard my childish dreams before I had really finished with
them, the lovely melodies of the flute-player served to enrich my
latter years at school with much of the old enchantment.&nbsp;
Often enough he would play to me at night during preparation, and
I would spend my time in trying to set words to his tunes instead
of doing my lessons.&nbsp; It was then that I regretted the lost
years that had dulled my ear and prevented me from winning the
inmost magic of his song, compared with which my verses seemed
but the shadow of a shadow.&nbsp; Yet I saw that he was content
with my efforts, and gradually made the discovery that while
great achievement is granted to the fortunate, it is the fine
effort that justifies a man to himself.&nbsp; What did it matter
whether my songs were good or bad?&nbsp; They were the highest
expression I could find for the <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>rapture of beauty that had filled my
heart as a child when I had been gifted to see life with clean
and truthful eyes.&nbsp; For the songs the flute-player played to
me were the great dreams of my childhood, the dreams that a wise
man prolongs to the day of his death.</p>
<p>I do not hear him often now, for I have learnt my lesson, and
though my hands tremble and my ear deceives me, I am by way of
being a flute-player myself.&nbsp; This article, it is clear, is
a child&rsquo;s dream, and so have been, and will be, I hope, all
the articles I shall ever write.&nbsp; What else should we write
about?&nbsp; We have learnt a few long words since we grew up,
and a few crimes, but no new virtues.&nbsp; That is why I like to
get back to the nursery floor, and play with the old toys and
think the old thoughts.&nbsp; We knew intuitively then a number
of beautiful truths that circumstance appears to deny now, and we
grown men are the poorer in consequence.&nbsp; It is folly to
find life ugly when the flute lies within our reach and we can
pipe ourselves back to the world of beauty with a song made of an
old dream.</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>As
for the flute-player, if I see him no more with wakeful eyes, I
know that he is never very far away.&nbsp; Likely enough one of
these wintry evenings, in the hour before bedtime, when the fire
burns brighter and brighter in the hearth, I shall look up and
see him sitting astride of the fireguard and puffing out his
cheeks over his shining flute.&nbsp; Not many nights ago I heard
some one playing the flute out in the street, and I went down and
found a poor fellow blowing his heart out for rare
<i>sous</i>.&nbsp; There was not much enchantment about
him&mdash;he had been dismissed from a music-hall orchestra for
drinking red wine to excess&mdash;but he was a real flute-player,
and I could well imagine that such a man might be driven to
intemperance by the failure to achieve those &ldquo;unheard
melodies&rdquo; not to be detected by the sensual ear.&nbsp; To
be a bad flute-player must be rather like being a bad poet, a
joyous but sadly finite life.&nbsp; He was a sad dog, this
earthly musician, and he frankly conceived the ideal state as a
kind of communal Bodega where thirsty souls could find peace in
satiety.&nbsp; I gave him fivepence to <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>help him on
his way, and left him to make doleful music in the night till he
had enough money to supply his crimson dreams.&nbsp; But he ought
not to have said that my flute-player was only an amateur.</p>
<h2><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>THE
WOOL-GATHERER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he walked down the streets
with his head drooping towards the pavement and his hands thrust
deep into the pockets of his overcoat the grown-ups would say,
&ldquo;There goes poor Mr. X. wool-gathering as usual&rdquo;; and
we children used to wonder what he did with all the wool and
where he found it to gather.&nbsp; Perhaps he collected it from
the thorn-bushes whereon the sheep had scratched themselves, or
perhaps, being a magician, he had found a way to shear the flocks
that we often saw in the sky on fine and windy days.&nbsp; At all
events, for a while his strange calling made us regard him with
interest as a man capable of doing dark and mysterious
things.&nbsp; Then the grown-ups tried to dispel our illusions by
explaining that they only meant that he was absent-minded, a
dreamer, an awful warning to young folk <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>who had
their way to make in the world.&nbsp; This admirable moral
lesson, like most of their moral lessons, failed because they did
not appreciate the subtlety of our minds.&nbsp; We saw that the
wool-gatherer did no recognisable work, wore comfortably untidy
clothes, walked in the mud as much as he wanted to, and, in fine,
lived a life of enviable freedom; and we thought that on the
whole when we grew up we should like to be wool-gatherers
too.&nbsp; Even the phrase &ldquo;absent-minded&rdquo; excited
our admiration; for we knew that it would be a fine thing if our
thoughts could travel in foreign countries, where there are
parrots and monkeys loose in the woods, while our bodies were
imprisoned in the schoolroom under the unsympathetic supervision
of the governess of the moment.&nbsp; Although we no longer
credited him with being a magician, the tardy explanations of the
grown-ups had, if anything, increased his glamour.&nbsp; It
seemed to us that he must be very wise.</p>
<p>He lived in an old house a little way out of the town, and the
house stood in a garden after our own heart.&nbsp; We knew by the
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>shocked
comments of our elders that it had formerly been cut and trimmed
like all the other gardens with which we were acquainted, but it
was now a perfect wilderness, a delightful place.&nbsp; My
brother and I got up early one morning when the dew was on the
world and explored it thoroughly.&nbsp; `We found a goat in an
outhouse and could see the marks in the meadow that had once been
a lawn, where he was tethered during the day.&nbsp; The
wool-gatherer was evidently in the habit of sitting under a tree
that stood at one corner, for the earth was pitted with the holes
that had been made by the legs of his chair.&nbsp; Being a wise
man, we thought it probable that he conversed with his goat and
could understand the answers of that pensive animal, who wagged
his beard at us when we peeped shyly into his den.&nbsp; In the
long grass by the tree we found a book bound like a school prize
lying quite wet with the dew.&nbsp; It was full of cabalistic
signs, and we took care to leave it where we found it lest it
should be black magic, though now I would support the theory that
Mr. X. read his Homer in the original.&nbsp; Taking it <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>altogether,
it was the most sensible garden we had ever seen, with plenty of
old fruit-trees, but with none of those silly flower-beds that
incommode the careless feet of youth.&nbsp; Our expedition
enhanced our opinion of the wool-gatherer&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>Here at least was a grown-up person who knew how to live in a
decent fashion, and when he ambled by us in the market-place, his
muddy boots tripping on the cobbles, and the pockets of his
green-grey overcoat pulled down by the weight of his hands, our
eyes paid him respectful tribute.&nbsp; He really served a useful
purpose in our universe, for he showed us that it was possible to
grow old without going hopelessly to the bad.&nbsp; Sometimes,
considering the sad lives of our elders who did of their own free
will all the disagreeable things that we were made to do by
force, we had been smitten with the fear that in the course of
years we, too, would be afflicted with this melancholy
disease.&nbsp; The wool-gatherer restored our confidence in
ourselves.&nbsp; If he could be grown-up without troubling to be
tidy or energetic, why, then, so could we!&nbsp; It amused <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>us to feel
that our affronted rulers were itching to give him a good talking
to and to send him off to brush his clothes and his boots; but he
was beyond the reach of authority, this splendid man.&nbsp; And
one of these days we thought that we, too, would enjoy this
delightful condition of freedom, for, like many grown men and
women, we did not realise that liberty is a state of mind and not
an environment.</p>
<p>We had never seen the inside of his house, but we could
imagine what it was like.&nbsp; No doubt he kept his servants in
proper order and did not allow them to tidy up, so that his
things lay all over the room where he could find them when he
wanted them.&nbsp; He had a friendly cat, with whom we were
acquainted, so that he would not lack company, and probably on
wet days when he could not go out into the garden he had the goat
in to play with him.&nbsp; He went to bed when he liked and got
up when he liked, and had cake for every meal instead of common
bread.&nbsp; A man like that would be quite capable of having a
sweetshop in one of the rooms, with a real pair of scales, so
that <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>he
could help himself whenever he wanted to.&nbsp; Whenever our own
lives grew a little dull we played at being the wool-gatherer,
but although he occupied such a large part of our thoughts we
never dared to speak to him, because we were afraid of his
extraordinary wisdom.&nbsp; This was not our normal reason for
avoiding the society of grown-up people.</p>
<p>When one day a funeral passed us in the street, and we were
told that it was the wool-gatherer&rsquo;s, we shook our heads
sceptically.&nbsp; The coffin was quite new and shiny, and all
the horses had their hoofs neatly blacked, and we thought we knew
our man better than that.&nbsp; But as day followed day and we
met him no more our doubts were overcome, and we knew that he was
dead.&nbsp; After a while his will was published in the local
newspaper, and the grown-ups were greatly impressed, because it
seemed that he had been very rich and had left all his money to
hospitals.&nbsp; Secretly we patronised them for their tardy
discovery of our man&rsquo;s worth; it had not needed any
newspaper to tell us that he was remarkable.&nbsp; But when some
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>new
people took his house and cut down all the bushes and tidied up
the garden we were really hurt, and began to realise what we had
lost.&nbsp; Where should we play now these hot nights of summer
when the hours passed so slowly and we could not sleep?&nbsp;
They had made his beautiful wilderness as dull as our own, and
our dreams must find a new playground.&nbsp; We never heard what
happened to the goat.</p>
<p>Now that I am myself grown-up, though children occasionally
flatter me by treating me as an equal, I revert sometimes to our
earliest thoughts and wonder what the wool-gatherer did with all
his wool.&nbsp; Perhaps he wove it into blankets for the poor
dreamless ones of the world.&nbsp; They are many, for it is not
so easy to be absent-minded as people think; in the first place,
it is necessary to have a mind.&nbsp; It is wrong also to believe
that wool-gatherers fill no useful place in life.&nbsp; I have
shown how Mr. X., lost in his world of dreams, was yet of real
service to us as children, and in the same way I think that we
who live the hurried life derive genuine satisfaction from the
spectacle of <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>the dreamers sauntering by.&nbsp; If they serve no
other purpose, they are at least milestones by aid of which we
can estimate our own speed, and if no one were idle we would win
no credit from our marvellous energy.&nbsp; Also they are happy,
and the philosopher will always hesitate to condemn the way of
life of a man who succeeds in that task.&nbsp; Perhaps we should
all be better off gathering wool!</p>
<h2><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>THE
PERIL OF THE FAIRIES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is something to have heard once
in a lifetime the ecstatic thrill that glorifies Essex Hall while
that intellectual pirate Mr. Bernard Shaw sails out and scuttles
a number of little merchant ships of thought that have never hurt
anybody.&nbsp; The applause and admiring laughter that punctuate
his periods really suggest that Fabianism makes people happy,
while the continued prosperity of the group gives the lie to the
cynic who reminded me how popular ping-pong was while the craze
lasted, and how utterly forgotten it is to-day.&nbsp; But I had
to rub my eyes while I stood in the overcrowded room, listening
to Puck in Jaeger, more witty, perhaps, than the old Puck, but no
less boyishly malicious, and ask myself whether, after all, this
was only the old magic in a new form.&nbsp; True, civilisation
had perforce <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>made him larger in order that human beings might
appreciate his eloquence, and I saw no traces of wings or magic
flowers.&nbsp; But beyond that I recognised the same pitying
contempt for mortals, the same arrogant confession of his own
faults, the same na&iuml;ve cunning.&nbsp; And then (perhaps a
turn of the voice did it, or some slight slurring of the words)
the enchantment passed, the ears of his audience resumed their
ordinary dimensions, and I offered mentally two teaspoonfuls of
honey to the real Puck, for I saw that he had tricked me into
recognising his qualities in the most serious man the twentieth
century knows.</p>
<p>Yet, though I found Mr. Shaw to be only a prophet and his
fellow-Fabians honest enthusiasts instead of bewitched weavers, I
cannot say that the discovery left my mind at ease for the
welfare of the fairy kingdom that is so important to every one
who has not forgotten it.&nbsp; What if this terrible seriousness
were to spread?&nbsp; What if every one were to turn
prophet?&nbsp; What if a night should come when never a child in
all the Duke of York&rsquo;s Theatre would clap its hands <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>to keep
Tinker Bell alive?&nbsp; At first I wished to reject this
frightful end of all our play and laughter and wonder as
impossible.&nbsp; Yet sinister stories of children who preferred
sewing-machines and working models to dolls and tin soldiers rose
in my mind, and it is hardly more than a step from that degree of
progress to the case of the child who may find the science of
sanitation more interesting than tales of fairies.&nbsp; The
possibility should make even the extremists shudder, but it must
be remembered that many honest people believe in technical
education, and that for that matter practically the whole of the
teaching in our schools takes the form of an attack on the
stronghold of the imaginative child.&nbsp; It is our barbarous
custom to supplant a child&rsquo;s really beautiful theories with
the ugly crudities which we call facts, and it is impossible to
realise how much humanity loses in the process.&nbsp; As for the
fairies, frail little folk at best, how shall they prevail
against the criticism of our sulphur and the cunning of our
permanganate of potash?&nbsp; Shall we always be able to
distinguish them from microbes?</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>It
may be well to pause here and see whither the wise, serious men
of to-day are taking us.&nbsp; I suppose they will abolish
Will-o&rsquo;-the-Wisp by draining all the marshes, and their
extreme industry will render Puck&rsquo;s kindly household
labours ludicrously unnecessary.&nbsp; They will turn their
swords against all the bad barons, unjust kings, and spiteful
magicians, whose punishment has been hitherto the fairies&rsquo;
special task; and this they will do in blackleg fashion, neither
demanding nor receiving their just wages of beauty and
immortality.&nbsp; They will scornfully set aside the law, so
dear to the younger inhabitants of nurseries, by which it is
always the youngest son or the youngest daughter whom the gods
delight to honour.&nbsp; They will fill with porridge and deck
with flannel underclothing the little flower-girls and
crossing-sweepers, whose triumphs set faith in the eyes of
babes.&nbsp; With their hard, cruel facts they will completely
wreck the fairy civilisation which has taken centuries of
dreaming and wondering children to construct.&nbsp; They will
brush our fancies away like cobwebs.</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>A
while ago, when I was a little boy, some enemy seeing me admire
the stars thought it necessary to tell me exactly what they were;
later, my natural interest in the extraordinary behaviour of the
sea led another enemy to place a globe in my hands, and prick the
bubble of the universe with ridiculous explanations.&nbsp; So it
is that when I regard the heavens I see enormous balls of rotting
chemicals, rendered contemptibly small by distance, floating in a
thin fluid called space; so it is that when I look at the sea my
mind is occupied with stupid problems about the route of floating
bamboos, when I ought to be exalted as one who peers out through
the darkness towards the Unknown.&nbsp; Where there were two
then, there are to-day twenty kindly persons about every child,
eager to prove the things it would like to believe in
superstitions, and eager to explain away its miracles in terms of
dustcarts and vegetable soup.&nbsp; Our babies are taught to hang
out their stockings and to batter in their empty egg-shells, but
are reminded at the same moment that these charming rituals are
but follies, and that <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the capital of Scotland is
Edinburgh.&nbsp; Youngsters babble Imperialism and Socialism when
they ought to be standing on their heads to look at the
Antipodes, and their parents commend their common sense.&nbsp;
Already, I fear, the wings of many of the fairies are beginning
to fade, and Puck capers but mournfully in his lonely haunts.</p>
<p>But fairies, goblins, elves, call them what you will, they are
worth having, and that is why I would entreat the wise men who
are arranging to-morrow for us to spare them, even though they
have forgotten themselves all that the presence of fairies in the
world is worth.&nbsp; By all means feed the children and give
them Union Jacks, but let their faith in the beautiful be looked
to as well.&nbsp; And, finally, to the serious person who says
with raised eyebrows, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t honestly say you
believe in fairies!&rdquo; I would answer this: In a world which
at present is fiercely antagonistic to the belief in any emotion
less material than hunger, it is impossible to avoid occasional
doubt concerning the existence of anything which it is not
possible to eat.&nbsp; But when I am in <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>the company
of those who really do believe I do not fail to hear the echoes
of fairy laughter in their speech, and see the flicker of fairy
wings reflected in their eyes, and with this knowledge I am
content.</p>

212</span>DRURY LANE AND THE CHILDREN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have noticed that in writing
about pantomimes the critics of our contemporaries usually make
two rather serious mistakes.&nbsp; The first is the assumption
that pantomime is really intended for the amusement of children,
and the second (which to a certain extent is implicit in the
first) is the conclusion that most pantomimes are unsatisfactory
because they fail to provide the children with suitable
fare.&nbsp; A glance at any pantomime audience should dispel the
first illusion.&nbsp; Even at matin&eacute;es the children are in
the minority, while at night the disproportion is quite
startling.&nbsp; To us it seems that the real purpose of modern
pantomime is to give conscientious objectors to music-halls an
opportunity of witnessing a music-hall entertainment without
shame.&nbsp; It follows that, even if the second criticism were
just, <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>it
would not be very important; but though we agree that the average
pantomime is far removed from the ideal entertainment for
children, it is at all events quite harmless, and contains a
number of elements that children like.&nbsp; They appreciate the
colour of the pageant, the papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; treasures,
the gilt moons and ultramarine sunsets, the jewelled and gilt
scenery; they like the funny clothes and red noses and boisterous
horseplay of the low comedians; they like the &ldquo;little
girls&rdquo; in short skirts, in whom the sophisticated recognise
the tired ladies of the ballet; they like, in fact, nearly all
the things which writers with sentimental views on children think
it necessary to condemn.&nbsp; As a general rule they do not care
for the love-making or the singing; after a long experience of
pantomimes we are prepared to say that they are right, though our
reasons are not perhaps theirs.&nbsp; The singing in pantomimes
is nearly always extremely bad, and the fact that the principal
boy is always the principal girl makes the love-scenes
ridiculous.&nbsp; The wonder is that in an entertainment that <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>must at all
costs be made attractive to adults there should be so much that
gives genuine pleasure to young people.</p>
<p>From the days of our youth we have always had a kindness for
Drury Lane Theatre, and, above all, for Drury Lane
pantomime.&nbsp; The theatre has an individual atmosphere, the
pantomime is not like the pantomime one sees anywhere else.&nbsp;
In order to appreciate the size of the place it is necessary to
put on a very small pair of knickerbockers and gaze upwards from
the stalls between the chocolates and the ices.&nbsp; It is like
looking into the deeps of heaven, though here the gods suck
oranges and make cat-calls&mdash;those fascinating sounds that
our youthful lips would never achieve.&nbsp; Drury Lane is the
only theatre that preserves the old glamour.&nbsp; We never enter
its doors without thinking of Charles Lamb, and it would hardly
astonish us if Mistress Nell Gwynn came to greet us with her
basket of China oranges, wearing that famous pair of thick
worsted stockings that the little link-boy gave her to save her
pretty feet from the chilblains.&nbsp; Outside, the image of
Shakespeare <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>leans on its pedestal, sadly contemplative of the grey
roofs of Covent Garden.&nbsp; The porters who carry about bunches
of bananas unconsciously reproduce the pictures of Mr. Frank
Brangwyn.&nbsp; If Shakespeare ever slips down from his perch to
watch a scene or two of the pantomime from the shadows of the
auditorium, he must wonder a little at our twentieth-century
masques.&nbsp; Like the children, he would probably appreciate
the splendid colour and brightness of the spectacle, and, having
been an actor himself, he would perhaps pardon the actors&rsquo;
cheerful neglect of the rights of the dramatist.&nbsp; For modern
pantomime is a business of strongly contrasted individualities
rather than the product of blended and related effort.&nbsp; This
is especially true of Drury Lane, whose stage at this season of
the year is always crowded with vaudeville Napoleons and
musical-comedy Cleopatras.&nbsp; In detail the pantomime is
excellent; as an artistic entity it does not exist.</p>
<p>At first sight this seems rather a pity.&nbsp; Given a
wonderfully appointed stage, gorgeous mounting, a fine orchestra,
and a <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>number of gifted performers, it is natural to expect
that the result should be more than the mere sum of these
units.&nbsp; But, as a matter of fact, pantomime is essentially
formless.&nbsp; Those critics who clamour for straightforward
versions of the old nursery stories would be vastly disappointed
if they got what they wanted.&nbsp; The old stories are well
enough when told by firelight in the nursery after tea of a
winter&rsquo;s evening.&nbsp; But they lack humour, and are not,
as a rule, dramatic.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Bluebeard,&rdquo; of course,
is a striking exception.)&nbsp; When a story lasting twenty
minutes must be expanded to last four hours the story is bound to
suffer.&nbsp; When, in addition, all the characters are played by
performers whose strength lies in their individuality, it will be
surprising if any part of the illusion created by the original
fable survives at all.</p>

217</span>CHILDREN&rsquo;S DRAMA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a season of the year when
children invade both the stage and the auditorium of many
theatres in unwonted numbers it would be at least topical to
speculate as to the philosophy of pantomime and the artistic
merits and defects of child actors and actresses.&nbsp; But while
juvenile mimicry of adult conceptions of drama is entertaining
enough, it is more to our purpose to consider the dramatic spirit
as it is actually present in children themselves.&nbsp;
Pantomimes certainly do not reflect this spirit, and, in spite of
the sentimental, but hardly more childish influence of
fairy-plays, are still aimed exclusively at adult audiences who
grant themselves no other opportunity of appreciating the humours
of the music-halls.&nbsp; Probably the ideal children&rsquo;s
play would have the colour of pantomime, the atmosphere of <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&ldquo;Peter Pan,&rdquo; the poetry of the &ldquo;Blue
Bird,&rdquo; and, most important of all, a downright melodramatic
plot.&nbsp; It is this last that is invariably lacking in
entertainments nominally provided for children; it is the first
consideration in the entertainments they provide for
themselves.</p>
<p>If grown-up people were in the habit, which unfortunately they
are not, of meeting together in moments of relaxation and acting
little extemporary plays, these plays would surely give a
first-hand indication of the dramatic situations that interested
them.&nbsp; Yet this is what children are always doing, and in
terms of play every little boy is a dashing and manly actor and
every little girl a beautiful and accomplished actress.&nbsp;
From the first glad hour when little brother cries to little
sister, &ldquo;You be Red Riding Hood, and I&rsquo;ll be the wolf
and eat you!&rdquo; the dramatic aspect of life is never absent
from the mind of imaginative youth.</p>
<p>In one respect, at all events, these play-dramas of children
should meet with the approval of modern dramatic critics.&nbsp;
No one can accuse them of losing sight of the <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>motive of
their drama in elaboration of scenery or stage effects.&nbsp; A
chair will serve for a beleaguered castle, a pirate ship, or
Cinderella&rsquo;s coach in turn, and the costumes imitate this
Elizabethan simplicity.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it cannot be said
that their stage is entirely free from the tyranny of those
pernicious conventions that place obstacles in the way of
art.&nbsp; The law of primogeniture, always rigidly enforced in
nurseries, as Mr. Kenneth Grahame has observed, makes the eldest
brother as much of a nuisance as the actor-manager.&nbsp;
According to his nature, and the character of the play, he always
insists on being either hero or villain, and in the absence of
limelight contrives to give himself an exaggerated share both of
the action and of the dialogue.&nbsp; Sisters are placid
creatures and do not very much mind whether they have anything to
do or not as long as they can all be princesses; but it is hard
on a younger brother to be compelled to walk the plank, although
he has the heart of a pirate chief.&nbsp; And the fact that
whatever part he may play the eldest brother must triumph at the
end of the last act tends <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>to stereotype the lines along which
the drama develops.</p>
<p>As for the plays themselves, it must be owned that they cover
an extraordinary extent of ground, and display a variety that no
other repertory theatre can hope to equal.&nbsp; The present
writer has seen five children in one afternoon give spirited
performances of Aladdin, David and Goliath, an unnamed drama of
pirates, and the famous comedy of teacher and naughty
pupils.&nbsp; This last is the standard performance of Elementary
School girls all over London, and to the discerning critic
displays just those faults of sophistication and over-elaboration
to which long runs at our theatres have made us accustomed.&nbsp;
The teacher is always too monotonously ill-tempered, the pupils
are ill-behaved beyond all discretion; Ibsen, one feels, would
have expressed this eternal warfare between youth and authority
in subtler terms.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, London children
achieve a really startling realism in their games; and the
looker-on may derive a considerable knowledge of the mothers from
watching the children perform <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>in some such drama of life as the
ever-popular &ldquo;Shopping on Saturday Night.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
may be noted here that children&rsquo;s rhapsodies over dolls and
kittens, or, indeed, over anything, are always clever pieces of
character-acting.&nbsp; Naturally, children do not rhapsodise,
but they soon learn the secret of the art from observation of
their elders.</p>
<p>But though in large towns the poorer children may not have
escaped the spirit of the age, so that their art hardly raises
them from the grey levels of their lives, children in general are
eager to find the artistic symbol for their dreams, and allow
realism but an accidental share in the expression of their
romantic ideals.&nbsp; They do not seek the materials for their
dramas in the little comedies and tragedies of nursery or
schoolroom life; they prefer to forget that ordinary everyday
happenings have ever wooed them to tributary laughters or tears,
and fulfil their destiny as pirates or highwaymen, fairies or
forlorn princesses.</p>
<p>Probably the nearest approach to children&rsquo;s drama that
we have on the modern stage is the so-called cloak-and-sword
drama.&nbsp; <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>Children&rsquo;s plays are full of action; speeches are
short and emphatic, and attempts at character-acting are
desultory and provocative of laughter in the other members of the
company.&nbsp; The fights are always carried out with spirit and
enthusiasm.&nbsp; To have seen Captain Shark, that incarnadined
pirate, wiping his sword on his pinafore is to have realised that
beauty of violence for which Mr. Chesterton pleads so eloquently
in the &ldquo;Napoleon of Notting Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the nature of the dramas that children play to
please themselves, it should be possible to lay down certain
rules as to the composition of plays for their
entertainment.&nbsp; Working by light of Stevenson&rsquo;s
lantern, Mr. Barrie has done good work in &ldquo;Peter
Pan,&rdquo; but he has made tremendous mistakes.&nbsp; The scene
on the pirate ship is perfect, a model of what such a scene
should be, with plenty of fighting and no burdensome excess of
talk.&nbsp; But in a play that is essentially a boys&rsquo; play
Wendy is a mistake.&nbsp; There was no Wendy on Stevenson&rsquo;s
island of treasure, and her continual intrusion into the story
would not be tolerated <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>in any nursery.&nbsp; In real life
she would either have had to discard her sex and become a member
of the band, or else have adopted the honorary r&ocirc;le of
princess and stayed tactfully in the background.&nbsp; The Pirate
Chief is very good&mdash;so good, in fact, that it looks very
like an eldest brother&rsquo;s part, in which case he would have
beaten Peter and made him walk the plank.&nbsp; The end, though
pleasing to adult minds, is impossible from a childish point of
view.&nbsp; The boys would never have left their fun of their own
free will.&nbsp; The gong ought to have sounded for tea, or
perhaps Mr. Darling could have returned from the City with some
mysterious parcels for the children to open.&nbsp; That is how
things really happen.&nbsp; To our mind, as we have said above,
the greatest fault a play for children can have is the lack of a
straightforward plot that allows of plenty of stirring and
adventurous action.&nbsp; Children love stories, whether they be
make-up stories of their own or real stories told them by some
one else.&nbsp; The hero of the play should be the biggest boy
acting it; the female characters should have no greater share of
<a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>the
action than the most rudimentary sense of politeness would allow
them, but they may sit in the background, mute but beautiful
princesses, as much as they like, and they are permitted to
comment on the courage of the hero when occasion offers.&nbsp;
Successful scenes should be repeated three or four times till
their possibilities had been exhausted.&nbsp; Every now and then,
if realism is desired, nurse or governess should look through the
door and say, &ldquo;Children, don&rsquo;t be rough,&rdquo; to
which the whole company must reply, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only
playing!&rdquo;&nbsp; Once at least in the course of the play one
of the smaller members of the company should be smitten into
tears, to be comforted by the princesses.&nbsp; The actors should
quarrel freely among themselves and throw up their parts every
half-hour, but, on the whole, they should all enjoy themselves
enormously.</p>
<p>Such an entertainment, we admit, would be intolerable to the
sentimental adult; but the criticisms of the children in the
audience would be worth hearing.</p>

225</span>CHILDHOOD IN RETROSPECT</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In age to wish for youth is full as
vain,<br />
As for a youth to turn a child again.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Denham</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is to be supposed that there are
few men and women who do not occasionally look back on the days
of their childhood with regret.&nbsp; The responsibilities of age
are sometimes so pressing, its duties so irksome, that the most
contented mind must travel back with envy to a period when
responsibilities were not, and duties were merely the simple
rules of a pleasing game, the due keeping of which was sure to
entail proportionate reward.</p>
<p>And this being so, and the delights of the Golden Age always
being kept in the back of our mind, as a favourable contrast to
the present state of things, it is hardly <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>surprising
that in course of time, the memory of the earlier days of our
life is apt to become gilded and resplendent, and very unlike the
simple, up and down April existence that was really ours.&nbsp;
The dull wet days, the lessons and the tears are all forgotten;
it is the sunshine and the laughter and the play that
remain.&nbsp; But it by no means follows that such hoarding up of
pleasant memories tends to make a man discontented with his lot;
it would rather seem that they impart something of their good
humour to the mind in which they are stored, so that the sunshine
of former jolly days returns to yield an aftermath of more sober
joy, and to help to light out our later years with a becoming
glow of cheerfulness.&nbsp; And on the other hand you will find
that an habitually discontented man will be quite unwilling to
own that the days of his youth, at all events, were happy.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the most natural result of this
glorification of our own childhood is a liking for
children.&nbsp; Seeing them naughty or good, at work or at play,
our minds straightway step back through the <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>span of
years to greet a little one who behaved in just such a way; and
the sympathetic understanding thus engendered, shows us the
surest way, both to manage children of our own, and to make
friends with those of others.</p>
<p>It is impossible to conceive a man, bearing his own childhood
in mind, behaving unjustly or unkindly to a child.&nbsp; For
seeing that we perceive in every child a more or less distinct
reflection of our own child nature, such conduct would be
something suicidal.&nbsp; How much of the child is still
contained within our mature mind is difficult to judge&mdash;some
people have much more than others.&nbsp; And it is these people
who can peel off their experience and knowledge like an athlete
stripping for a race, and who can step out to play not only with
the same spirit and excitement, but even with the same mental
processes as a child; these are they who can readily obtain
admission into the sacred circle of child games, and who can
fancy, for just as long as the game lasts, that they are once
more wandering in that fairy garden from whose easy paths <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>of laughter
and innocence our aching feet are banished for ever.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the cure for this nostalgia of childhood, which
seizes the best of us from time to time, and causes us to batter
vainly at fast-locked nursery doors, or to look sadly at the
gaudy toyshops, robbed by the cynical years of their fit
halo.&nbsp; When this melancholy falls on us, and we who are
respectable forty feel like senile eighty, let us forthwith seek
the company of little children, and so elude the fatal black
dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sophocles did not blush to play with
children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why should we?&nbsp; And for those who are
not fortunate enough to number in their acquaintance children of
the right age and humour, here, as the cookery books say, is a
tried receipt.</p>
<p>Take a copy of Mr. Barrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Little White
Bird,&rdquo; together with a large bag of sweets, and sally to
the park.&nbsp; The rest depends on your address, but for a shy
man a puppy will prove an invaluable aid to the making of
acquaintances.&nbsp; And if, as has happened to ourselves, at the
end of a delightful afternoon a little lady of some seven years
should, <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>abjuring words, fling her arms round your neck and
press an uncommonly sticky pair of lips on a cheek which, till
that moment we will suppose better acquainted with the razor, why
then, if not sooner, you will have learnt that the whole
philosophy of growing old is the increasing pleasure you can take
in the society of the young; this, once determined, a vista of
most charming days lies before you, and sorrow for a nursery
cupboard that has gone into the Ewigkeit will be forgotten in
helping some diminutive neighbour to explore hers.</p>
<p>Southey was really stating this idea when he wrote in
&ldquo;The Doctor&rdquo; that &ldquo;A house is never perfectly
furnished for enjoyment, unless there is a child in it rising
three years or a kitten rising six weeks,&rdquo; though to our
mind the presence of both would be the ideal arrangement, since
the kitten would take the place of the puppy previously
mentioned, for the child to play with.</p>
<p>If we wish to support age kindly, it is only to be done by
surrounding ourselves with youth.&nbsp; And the laughter of
children, surely the purest and sweetest of all music, <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>will strike
a responsive chord in our breasts, and will enable us to live
through the years that wither, in all harmony and
contentment.</p>
<h2><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>THE
FOLLY OF EDUCATION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the intellectual exercises
with which we solace the idle hours that we devote to thought,
none is more engaging and at the same time perplexing than that
of endeavouring to form a clear conception of the age in which we
live.&nbsp; Naturally the difficulty lies, not in lack of
materials on which to base an impression&mdash;indeed, we are
embarrassed by the quantity of evidence that accumulates to our
hand&mdash;but in the fact that it is hard to see things in true
perspective when they are very near to the observer.&nbsp; The
yet unborn historians of the present era will doubtless lack much
of our knowledge, but they will be able to unravel in the
quietude of their studies the tangled threads and stubborn knots
that writhe beneath our fingers with the perpetual changeableness
and uneasy animation of life <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>itself.&nbsp; But if it is
impossible to write dispassionately of a revolution while men are
dying at the barricades and musket-balls are marring the bland
uniformity of the wallpaper of the room in which we write, it is
always open to the student of life to fall back on impressionism,
the form of art that seeks to bludgeon life with a loaded phrase,
rather than to woo her to captivity with chosen and honeyed
words.&nbsp; And the brutal method is apt to prove the more
efficacious, as with that frail sex that kisses, so I am told,
the masculine hand that grants the accolade of femininity in that
blessed state of bruiser and bruised that is Nature&rsquo;s
highest conception of the relationship of the two sexes.&nbsp;
While science greets the corpse with incomprehensible
formul&aelig; and the conscientious artist gropes for his
note-book of epithets to suit occasions, impressionism stops her
dainty nose with her diminutive square of perfumed silk, and the
dog is dead indeed.</p>
<p>We are all born impressionists, and it takes the education of
years to eradicate the gift from our natures; many people never
<a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>lose the
habit of regarding life in this queer, straightforward fashion,
and go to their graves obstinately convinced that grass is green
and the sky is blue in dogged opposition to the scientists,
didactic dramatists, eminent divines, philosophers,
&aelig;sthetic poets, and human beings born blind.&nbsp; Some of
these subtle weavers of argument would have us believe that
impressionism means just the converse of the sense in which I am
using the word; that, for instance, the fact that grass is green
comes to us from indirect sources, as that of our own natures we
would perceive it to be red or blue.&nbsp; But while we believe
our impressions to be our own, we know that this theory has
reached us indirectly, so we can well afford to ignore it.&nbsp;
Others, again, will have it that impressions are not to be
trusted; and the majority of people, while rejecting or failing
to comprehend the philosophic basis on which this doubt is
founded, are only too willing to accept a theory that relieves
them in some way of responsibility for their own individual
actions.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, telling a man to mistrust his
impressions is <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>like bidding a mariner despise his compass.&nbsp; If
our senses lie to us, we must live, perforce, in a world of
lies.</p>
<p>But as I hinted above, the young are wont to rely on their
impressions from the moment when a baby first parts its lips in
howling criticism of life.&nbsp; Children have implicit faith in
the evidence of their senses until the grown-up people come along
and tell grimy stories of perjured eyes and lying ears, and the
unhappy fate of the unwise babes who trusted them.&nbsp; What is
a child to do?&nbsp; Usually it accepts the new theory of its own
inherent blindness and deafness grudgingly, but it accepts it
nevertheless.&nbsp; It begins to rely on the experience of older
human beings, as if the miracle of its own life were no more than
the toneless repetition of other lives that have been before
it.&nbsp; Wonder passes from its life, as joy passes from pencil
and paper when the little fingers are made to follow certain
predestined lines, instead of tracing the fancies of the
moon.&nbsp; The child becomes sensible, obedient, quick at its
lessons.&nbsp; It learns the beauty of the world from pictures
and the love of its <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>mother from books.&nbsp; In course
of time its senses become atrophied through disuse, and it can,
in truth, no longer see or hear.&nbsp; When this stage is reached
the education of the individual is completed, and all
civilisation&rsquo;s requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p>I have described an extreme case, and the judicious reader
will realise that the process is rarely completed in so short a
time as the last paragraph suggests.&nbsp; But sooner or later
most men and women come to believe in experience, and to this
belief is due our tyrannous treatment of the young.&nbsp; I can
conceive that an age will come that will shrink with horror from
the excesses we commit in the name of education, and will regard
us who force children to do their lessons against their will very
much in the way in which we regard the slave-owners of the past,
only with added indignation that our tyranny is imposed on the
children&rsquo;s minds, and not on the bodies of adults.&nbsp;
Let those conservative readers who find this comparison a little
strained reflect for a moment on what it is that we have to teach
the next generation, with what manner of <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>wisdom we
chain the children&rsquo;s imaginations and brand their
minds.&nbsp; We teach them in the first place to express
themselves in sounds that shall be intelligible to us, and this,
I suppose, is necessary, though I should like to doubt it.&nbsp;
Further, we invariably instruct them in the sciences of reading
and writing, which seems to me frankly unfortunate.&nbsp; In
Utopia, as I conceive it, the child who thought there was
anything worth reading would teach itself to read, as many
children have done before it, and in the same way the rarer child
who desired to express itself on paper would teach itself to
write.&nbsp; That any useful purpose is served by the general
possession of this knowledge I cannot see.&nbsp; Even
civilisation cannot rejoice that her children are able to read
the Sunday newspapers and scrawl gutter sentiments on the walls
of churches.</p>
<p>Beyond this we teach children geography, which robs the earth
of its charm of unexpectedness and calls beautiful places by ugly
names; history, which chronicles inaccurate accounts of
unimportant events in the ears of those who would be better
employed in <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>discovering the possibilities of their own age;
arithmetic, which encourages the human mind to set limits to the
infinite; botany, which denotes the purposeless vivisection of
flowers; chemistry, which is no more than an indelicate unveiling
of matter; and a hundred other so-called arts and science, which,
when examined without prejudice, will be found to have for their
purpose the standardisation and ultimate belittlement of
life.</p>
<p>In Utopia, the average human being would not know how to read
or write, would have no knowledge of the past, and would know no
more about life and the world in general, than he had derived
from his own impressions.&nbsp; The sum of those impressions
would be the measure of his wisdom, and I think that the chances
are that he would be a good deal less ignorant than he is now,
when his head is full of confused ideas borrowed from other men
and only half-comprehended.&nbsp; I think that our system of
education is bad, because it challenges the right of the
individual to think constructively for himself.&nbsp; In rustic
families, where the father and <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>mother have never learnt to read and
the children have had the advantages of
&ldquo;scholarship,&rdquo; the illiterate generation will always
be found to have more intelligence than their educated
descendants.&nbsp; The children were learning French and
arithmetic when they should have been learning life.</p>
<p>And, after all, this is the only kind of education that
counts.&nbsp; We all know that a man&rsquo;s knowledge of Latin
or the use of the globes does not affect his good-fellowship, or
his happiness, or even the welfare of the State as a whole.&nbsp;
What is important is, that he should have passed through certain
experiences, felt certain emotions, and dreamed certain dreams,
that give his personality the stamp of a definite individual
existence.&nbsp; Tomlinson, the book-made man, with his
secondhand virtues and secondhand sins, is of no use to any
one.&nbsp; Yet while we all realise this, we still continue to
have a gentle, unreasoning faith in academic education; we still
hold that a man should temper his own impressions with the
experience of others.</p>
<h2><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>ON
COMMON SENSE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> this time last year I was
fortunate enough to go to a very nice children&rsquo;s party, or,
rather, a very nice party for children.&nbsp; I add the
appreciative epithet because there was only one grown-up person
there, and that person was not I; and when all is said it may be
stated confidently that the fewer the grown-ups the better the
children&rsquo;s party.&nbsp; Nevertheless, although there was
only one grown-up for about thirty children, and she the most
charming and tactful of girls, I had not been long in the place
of fairy-lamps before I discovered that with one exception I was
the youngest person there.&nbsp; I had come out that night in the
proper party frame of mind.&nbsp; My shoes were tight and my mind
was full of riddles of which I had forgotten the answers, and as
I drove along in a four-wheeler&mdash;who ever went to a party <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>in anything
else?&mdash;I noticed that the stars smelt of tangerine
oranges.&nbsp; When I reached the house everything looked all
right.&nbsp; The place was very busy, and there were lots of
white frocks and collars, and pink faces.</p>
<p>Yes, it ought to have been a jolly party, but it came about
twenty years too late, and the children, I had almost added, were
about twenty years too old.&nbsp; Instead of forgetting
everything else in the whirl and clamour of play and dancing,
they were, it seemed to me, too busy registering the impressions
to enjoy themselves.&nbsp; One of them, a child of eleven, was
already smitten with a passion for the <i>mot juste</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My tongue,&rdquo; she told me gravely, &ldquo;is like a
cloud&rdquo;; and, later, &ldquo;a marigold is like a
circus.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had a crushing word for a comrade who
was looking at herself in a mirror.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you
don&rsquo;t <i>really</i> look as nice as you do in the
looking-glass!&rdquo;&nbsp; The other children did not seem much
better, and I stood forlornly in their midst, as a child stands
among the creased trouser-legs of its elders, until I saw a
scared little face in a corner apart from the rest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you playing?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; The <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>child
looked me straight in the face, and burst into a thousand
tears.&nbsp; At least here was something young, something not
wholly wise.&nbsp; We sat together, exchanging grave confidences
all the evening.</p>
<p>Possibly this is a queer way in which to start an article on
common sense, but there is more than madness in my method, for I
feel assured that the children have derived their new
wisdom&mdash;a senseless wisdom, a wisdom of facts&mdash;from
their absurd parents.&nbsp; The latest creed, the belief that
comfort for the masses prevents remorse in the individual, may be
well enough in its way, but it creates a very bad atmosphere in
which to bring up children.&nbsp; They are taught that life is an
agglomeration of facts, and no sort of miracle, and by learning
these facts like little parrots they lose the whole thrill and
adventure of life.&nbsp; They do not go out to kill dragons,
because they know that there are no dragons there.&nbsp; Chivalry
survived with children long after common sense had killed it as
dead as mutton in the adult mind.&nbsp; But now they, too, have
found it out, and there are only a few silly poets and mad <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>lovers to
keep the memory of Quixote green.</p>
<p>What are these facts by which we are to guide our lives, of
which, indeed, our lives are to consist?&nbsp; One of the
simplest, one that has come to have the force of a proverbial
expression, is the fact that two and two make four, and this is
one of the first things we teach our children.</p>
<p>I have a friend who suspects that in moments of intense
consciousness two and two, weary of making four, would make five
for a change.&nbsp; I have heard it argued against him by
mathematicians that the fourness of four&mdash;four&rsquo;s very
existence, as it were&mdash;depends on its being related to two
in the subtle fashion suggested by the well-known dogma, but I
can discern no grounds for this assertion.&nbsp; Consider the
fate that would befall a man who went for a ride on an omnibus
for the purpose of making use of this one fact.&nbsp; He might be
aware that the fare to Putney was fourpence, and, proud of his
mathematical knowledge, might pay his fare in two instalments of
twopence.&nbsp; What would be his consternation to find that, as
<a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>he
reached his journey&rsquo;s end, he would have to pay another
penny because he had not paid his fourpence in one lump
sum?&nbsp; In terms of &rsquo;bus fares, two and two do not make
four, and I would multiply examples of such exceptions to the
accepted rule.</p>
<p>But even if two and two really did make four, the fact would
remain supremely useless.&nbsp; However cunningly it was
conveyed, the statement would not abate one tear from the sorrows
of a child, nor would it brighten, even for an instant, the eyes
of a dying man.&nbsp; You could not win a girl with it, because
the man who counts his kisses is damned from the start.&nbsp; A
poet could not turn it into song; it would draw no briefest flame
from the ashes of a storyteller&rsquo;s fire.&nbsp; The thing is
cold, inhuman; it is made for lawyers and politicians, and the
persons who argue their lives away on matters of no
importance.&nbsp; We who are simpler never put two and two
together for the purpose of making four, for four is of no more
use to us than a nice brace of twos.&nbsp; The infinite is the
answer of all our mathematical problems, and if we cannot find it
we are <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>quick to sponge the sum off our slates.&nbsp; The
belief that two and two make four leads most people to think four
a better fellow than two; to hold, for instance, that a man with
four millions must be richer than a man with two, though the
groans of our pauper millionaires never cease to admonish our
national cupidity.&nbsp; Two and two make just what your heart
can compass, neither more nor less, and, if your unit is
worthless, they make nothing at all.</p>
<p>Facts are worse than useless, for they limit the journeys of
the human mind; but there is a common sense not founded on facts
that represents the extreme limits of our intellectual
pilgrimages.&nbsp; It is common only in this: it is true for all
humanity when humanity is wise enough to accept it.&nbsp;
Shakespeare had it deliciously, and even now we are only
beginning to learn the things he knew.&nbsp; For
instance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are such stuff as dreams are made of,<br
/>
And our little life is rounded with a sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems more wisely true to us to-day than it did to the
men and women of his <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>age, but it was as true when he
wrote it as it is now.&nbsp; Or again&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Men
must abide<br />
Their going hence even as their coming hither,<br />
Ripeness is all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the true common sense&mdash;all that we know, all that
we shall know; but this is not the thing that we teach the
children in our schools, nor is it the light by which most of us
guide our lives.&nbsp; We invent trivial rules and conventions to
belittle the life we have to lead, and make marks in the dust
with our fingers to cheat an uncheatable fate.&nbsp; We add
illusion to illusion in coward hopes of outliving the greatest
illusion of all.&nbsp; We add folly to folly, and lie to lie, and
are content that the results of our labours should be unwisdom
and untruth.&nbsp; We add two to two and worship the mournful
constancy of four.</p>
<p>I began my article on common sense with a children&rsquo;s
party; I must end it, I suppose, somewhere within the limits of
our unhoping lives.&nbsp; When the night of a hundred kisses
draws to a close, and Dawn, with her painted <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>smile,
creeps like a spy into the room, men and women believe that they
can see things as they really are.&nbsp; The earth is grey to
their eyes, though not more grey than their own tired flesh, and
their little hearts are quick to believe that grey is the normal
colour of life.&nbsp; The sun comes up and tints the world with
rose, and they forget their sorrow, as they have so often
forgotten it before, and go their boasting way through the world
they believe their own.&nbsp; Around them, in the light that is
not the sun&rsquo;s, the shadows tremble&mdash;shadows of the
dead, shadows of the yet unborn.&nbsp; The wise cannot tell them
apart.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
